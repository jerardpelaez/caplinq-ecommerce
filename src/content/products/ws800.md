shortDescription: CHEMLINQ WS800 is a specially formulated wetting and conditioning compound designed for use after the cleaning cycle of thermosetting transfer molds. This advanced compound is compatible with RCS series rubber cleaning materials. WS800 offers conditioning properties with minimal application shots, resulting in reliable mold performance without solderability issues or over-waxing of mold cavities. Its fast-curing formulation significantly reduces cure time, improving productivity and efficiency in mold conditioning. CHEMLINQ WS800 does not require preheating and lead frames during the conditioning process. The compound ensures a good release from the mold after curing, further shortening the time required for mold conditioning.

Instructions for Use





Place strips on the mold chase. Strip quantity depends on the mold dimension.




Clamp the mold and compress to fill all the cavities carefully, as overclamping may cause releasing difficulty from the mold.




Recommended cure time for 175 + 5 °C is 2–5 minutes. Cure time depends on the mold temperature.


- Avoid overcuring, i.e., curing at 175 °C for 10 minutes, because it may cause the material to stick to the mold.



Repeat until you achieve the required conditioning result.
