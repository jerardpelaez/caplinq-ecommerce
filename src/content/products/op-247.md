shortDescription: "Aculon OP-247 is a high-performance, nano-scale coating solution specifically formulated to enhance adhesion of acrylic-based and other reactive coatings on a wide variety of metal surfaces. Utilizing proprietary chemistry, OP-247 forms an ultra-thin monolayer (2–4 nm) that chemically bonds to the substrate, creating a highly active surface for (meth)acrylate, amine, and thiol-functional coatings—including epoxies and UV-cured resins. The treatment is solvent-based, non-toxic, and easy to integrate using standard wet application methods such as dipping, spraying, or wiping, without altering the appearance or structure of the underlying metal. Applications: Improve lead-frame adhesion in semiconductor packaging Enhance the bonding of epoxy over-mold compounds Prevent delamination in high-reliability finished goods Boost the adhesion of UV-curable coatings to metal substrates Strengthen bonds in electronics, automotive, and medical components"

Surface Preparation/ Cleaning: Ensure that the surface is free of any grease, fingerprints or dirt (i.e., water break free). This can be accomplished by first degreasing the surface with solvents or by rinsing with soap and water. The next step is to remove monolayer-scale contaminants. This is typically performed by using a cleaner specifically designed for the metal you are working with. Contact Aculon if you are unsure what cleaner to use and we will recommend one best suited for your application. The substrate should be water break - free before continuing to coating steps.


Treatment Application: Spray: Spray the solution onto the substrate using doubl e passes. Post-application curing is recommended for best performance. Spray Equipment Suggestions: HVLP (Binks Mach 1), HVLP (Devilbiss JGHV), Air Atomizatation (Devilbiss MBC gun), and Airless (Graco Model 225-292 President Pump Series A)


Dip: – Immerse the substrate in the solution for five minutes. If a shorter dip time is necessary, then a post-cure is recommended for optimal performance (sonication while dipping can boost performance in some cases).


Dip Coating with Sonication: Ensure the substrate is clean. Completely submerge the substrate in the solution and sonicate for five minutes. Remove substrate from the solution and allow to air dry , preferably in a clean area.


Drying/ Curing: If curing is necessary (short dip times or spray-application), the treated substrates are best cured at 120C peak metal temperature for approximately 30 seconds. For silicon and titanium oxides, lengthening the cure time to 5 minutes is recommended. *Note: If OP-247 is being used to adhere a high viscosity or low-reactive resin system, especially if such coating is not cured after application, then it is suggested to do a post cure rinsing step (or post-treatment rinse if curing was not performed) for best performance. Furthermore, if a UV-curable coating system is being used, then it may be necessary to modify the curing parameters to ensure sufficient radical generation near the surface of the monolayer to achieve optimal adhesion.


Safety, Handling, Storage, Shelf Life: Store in a cool (~25C) and dry area, and keep away from direct sun light. See this product’s MSDS for proper handling and fire hazard data. When stored properly, product has a 2 year shelf life from the date it is opened.
