shortDescription: "Hysol GR910-C4 is an improved version of GR910-C. This black, epoxy, semiconductor grade molding compound is designed for Memory ball grid arrays (BGA) and land grid arrays (LGA). Its small spherical silica cut (cut size of 53um), offers high fluidity and low smile shrinkage that aids a very advanced warpage control. There are two main differences between Hysol GR910-C4 and GR910-C. The first one is the filler cut size: C4 cut size is 53microns; C cut size is 75 microns. When a package design has very narrow gaps (100microns), C4 will be a better candidate and have better filling performance than C. The second and maybe most important difference between them is the warpage performance. C4 has smaller smile warpage than C with everything that entails. Hysol GR910-C4 is a halogen free, environmentally friendly compound with good electrical performance that meets UL 94 V-0 Flammability at 1/8 inch thickness. Main features are summarized: Moldability (Check the test results) Small filler cut (53um) to have good filling performance Good fluidity to prevent wire sweep (W/S) failures Reliability Low shrinkage ratio Low moisture absorption Excellent warpage control during PMC and reflow process Meet MSL3 @260°C requirements Proven reliability performance on BGA/LGA package Check the BGA package key considerations.
