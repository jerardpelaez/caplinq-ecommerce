### How to apply Aculon's Glass Repellency Treatment






STEP 1 ⇨ CLEAN




STEP 2 ⇨ TREAT




STEP 3 ⇨ DRY






Parts must be **sufficiently clean** before treatment for proper bonding and effective application. This can be accomplished by first degreasing the surface with solvents/rinsing with soap and water. To remove monolayer-scale contaminants, a substrate-specific cleaner is recommended based on the application. 


Dip - Fully immerse the part in the treatment solution for 1 minute. Withdraw the part at a steady rate to ensure even coverage. Allow to dry or cure depending on your substrate.






To dry, the part should be placed at room temperature with 40-50% relative humidity for ≥24 hours.


The product may also be cured for 2 hours at 150°C.


Higher temperature cures create coatings with increased durability.










Wipe - Using a clean cloth apply the treatment by wiping it across the surface in a buffing motion for 1 minute per square foot.






Spray - Spray the solution on the substrate, air dry. If the coating is too thick, reduce the amount applied by changing the settings on the spray gun or using a diluent.






Flow - Dispense the treatment over the surface, applying enough to coat the entire surface. Allow excess material to drain, it is advised to cure for durability.

### Application Tips



- Use a microfiber cloth to wipe after cleaning.

- Coat the substrate as soon as possible after cleaning to prevent recontamination.

- Spray Equipment Suggestions: HVLP(Binks Mach 1), HVLP(Devilbiss JGHV), Air Atomization(Devilbiss MBC gun), and Airless(Graco Model 225-292 President Pump Series A).

- Cure temperatures and conditions should be optimized based on substrate and durability requirements.








### How to test for Hydrophobicity


To test for hydrophobicity, allow water droplets to fall onto the surface, which should bead up to a contact angle >90⁰. If the contact angle is
