shortDescription: "LINQTAPE PET1S-UT-Clear is a 1-mil polyester film backing with an ultra thin pressure-sensitive silicone adhesive system. PET1S polyester tape is a no-residue tape designed for splicing and masking applications where high initial adhesion is required, but no residue once the tape is removed. LINQTAPE PET1S-UT-Clear is a high-performance, flexible, polyester tape used in a wide range of applications. For very high-temperature applications, polyimide tape should be used, but for applications with temperatures up to 200C, PET1S is the most effective and least expensive solution. Clear film especially for applications that require colorless film. Used for high-temperature masking in powder coating applications and as PCB protective masking during various phases of printed circuit board (PCB) production. Also excellent for splicing operations requiring silicone adhesive. Key Features: No residue High initial adhesion For splicing and masking For high temp masking in powder coating For PCB protective masking High performance Flexible"
