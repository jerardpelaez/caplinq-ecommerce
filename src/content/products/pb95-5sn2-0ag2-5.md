shortDescription: "LINQALLOY Pb95.5Sn2.0Ag2.5 is a lead tin silver alloy with a very high melting point and small transition phase. Even though the world is moving away from Lead for consumer electronics, there are still applications that cannot be supported with Lead Free alternatives due to their high operating temperatures. For those limited cases, we offer the LINQALLOY Pb95.5Sn2.0Ag2.5 solder wire that has an extremely high melting temperature. Features: Melting Temperature of 306°C (583°F) Ideal for High operating temperature applications"
