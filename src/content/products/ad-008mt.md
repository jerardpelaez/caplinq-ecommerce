Directions for Use



- When using this product, discard the front end of Part A and Part B. Mix the two parts and coat the product onto the substrate for maximum bonding performance.

- The adhesive should be applied on a clean surface free of dirt, grease, or mold release. In the case that it is coated with such, a simple solvent wipe will suffice.

- Mix thoroughly by volume (10:1 mix ratio) before use.

- After mixing the two parts, the adhesive should be used within its pot life.

- For maximum bonding strength, apply the adhesive evenly to both surfaces that will be joined together.

- For handling information, refer to the attached Technical Data Sheet.
