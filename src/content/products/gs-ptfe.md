shortDescription: "LINQSEAL GS-PTFE gaskets are made from a synthetic fluoropolymer of tetrafluoroethylene, known for its exceptional properties. The C–F bond within its polymer structure imparts inherent hydrophobicity, rendering PTFE ideal for applications requiring resistance to moisture and water-based substances. Moreover, PTFE boasts outstanding dielectric properties and remarkable temperature stability, ranging from –180 °C to 260 °C. Its unparalleled chemical resistance extends to acids, bases, and solvents. PTFE exhibits one of the lowest coefficients of friction against any solid, ensuring effective sealing and prolonged service life even in the most challenging environments. With all these exceptional properties, LINQSEAL GS-PTFE gaskets are widely used in industries requiring robust sealing solutions, including but not limited to automotive, aerospace, and manufacturing sectors. Custom LINQSEAL GS-PTFE gaskets can be tailored precisely to your specifications and drawings. The thickness ranges from 0.5 to 5.0 millimeters. The maximum dimensions are 1500 × 1500 mm2, while the minimum dimensions are 100 × 100 mm2. Key Features: Outstanding chemical resistance High electrical resistance High temperature stability (–180 °C to 260 °C) High resistance to creep under load or compression set Hydrophobic and non-corrosive Highly Recommended As: Cryogenic seals in oil & gas, pharmaceuticals, and aerospace sectors Pneumatic Seals Flat gaskets for water electrolyzers and fuel cells"
