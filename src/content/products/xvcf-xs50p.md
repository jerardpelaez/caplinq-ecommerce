shortDescription: LINQSTAT XVCF-XS50P is a highly conductive conductive polyurethane film with a very high electrically conductive carbon and graphene loading and a very dense polymer mix. Using a premium polymer and a refined process, we are able to increase the conductivity and thus reduce the surface resistance of the plastic to as low as ±30-50 ohms/sq of surface resistance. This extra loading allows the film to be used in applications that require a lower resistivity. Volume resistivity, based on the thickness of the material still needs to be measured. XVCF-XS50P conductive films are thin (±2.6 up to 3 mil), lightweight and relatively inert. Furthermore, they are well suited for applications requiring electrochemical reactions, high conductivity or charge storage including but not limited to electrodes (ECG, TENS, Defibrillation and Iontophoresis), batteries (flat-cell zinc/manganese dioxide (MnO2), Lithium Ion and Lithium polymer), wearable electronics and digital whiteboards. XVCF-XS50P film and its conductivity are unaffected by humidity and age. It has a standard thickness of ±66-70µm (2.6 - 2.75 mil) and is available in various lengths and widths upon request. This is one of the most conductive plastic films in our entire product line. It has an operating temperature of -10°C up to 120°C and its melting temperature is ~160-180°C.
