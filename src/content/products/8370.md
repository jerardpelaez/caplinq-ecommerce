shortDescription: LOCTITE ABLESTIK 8370 adhesive is designed for automatic dispensing operations, where silver migration is a concern. LOCTITE ABLESTIK 8370 is a dispensable gold filled adhesive than can replace Silver filled alternatives when migration is not acceptable at all. It is compatible with Noble substrate finishes and should not be used in Sn terminations. Even though Silver migration is unlikely to happen in ovemolded packages, there are certain applications that can be susceptible to it such as Automotive LED and that is where this high cost and high performance product shines.
