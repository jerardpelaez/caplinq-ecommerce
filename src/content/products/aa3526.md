shortDescription: "LOCTITE® AA 3526 is a translucent, pale straw to amber, 1-part, medium viscosity, UV/visible light-cured, liquid modified acrylic adhesive. It cures rapidly to form flexible, transparent bonds when exposed to ultraviolet light and/or visible light of sufficient irradiance. The secondary cure system permits cure of product in shadowed areas. LOCTITE® AA 3526 is an Acrylic, monocomponent liquid with positive fluoresence under UV light. It's bonding cure profile benefits high speed curing production lines. LOCTITE® AA 3526 can be cured by exposure to UV and/or visible light radiation or heat . The speed and depth of cure will depend on the UV intensity measured at the product surface. Heat Cure 15minutes at 121°C Fixture Time Fixture time is defined as the time to develop a shear strength of 0.1 N/mm². UV Fixture Time, Glass microscope slides, seconds: Black light, Zeta® 7500 light source: 6 mW/cm², measured @ 365 nm ≤5LMS"
