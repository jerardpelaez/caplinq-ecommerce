shortDescription: LOCTITE ABLESTIK EMI 8660S is an electrically conductive adhesive designed to achieve robust electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding performance with extremely thin coating thickness at a single micrometer level for package level shielding applications. The material has robust adhesion to mold compound, epoxy, copper, gold and silver surfaces. When spray-coated, this material can be atomized to highly fine droplets for excellent uniformity at low to high coating thicknesses which can be controlled by equipment parameters. LOCTITE ABLESTIK EMI 8660S is a sprayable, printable or dispensable silver sintering coating that exhibits high thermal and electrical conductivity. With good workability and a long work life, this material is typically used for RF, Wireless components, memories, sensors and other sensitive device applications. Cure Schedule 60 minutes @ 175°C
