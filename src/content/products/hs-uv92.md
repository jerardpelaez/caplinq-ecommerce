shortDescription: HumiSeal® UV92 is a soft, one part, UV curable masking material. HumiSeal® UV92 applies easily because of its shearing thinning viscosity profile and is 100% cured by exposure to UV to provide a temporary barrier to prevent ingress of coatings into keep out areas. HumiSeal® UV92 has excellent solvent resistance that provides selective release from conformal coating. HumiSeal® UV92 will survive intermittent exposure to temperatures up to 150°C. HumiSeal® UV92 is REACH and RoHS compliant and available in bulk and syringes. Target Applications Masking connectors, edge fingers, test pads, and switch bodies during conformal coating. Wave/selective soldering keep‑out protection on PCB assembly lines. Temporary protection of rework/repair areas prior to coating.

## Frequently Asked Questions About HumiSeal® UV92




### What are typical applications for HumiSeal® UV92?


HumiSeal® UV92 is a soft, peelable, UV-curable masking material used to protect keep-out zones during conformal coating, wave/selective soldering, and rework. Apply it where coating is not desired—e.g., on connectors, test pads, edge fingers, and switch bodies—then cure and peel away cleanly after processing.



- Electronics manufacturing (PCB assembly lines)

- Automotive & industrial control modules

- Aerospace/defense electronics needing clean contact points






### Why choose HumiSeal® UV92 over tapes or latex masks?


It dispenses easily thanks to a shear-thinning, thixotropic paste rheology; cures 100% under UV (LED 365/405 nm or “H” type microwave/arc lamps ≥200 mW/cm²); resists solvents for selective release from conformal coatings; peels cleanly with no residue; and won’t tarnish gold, tin, copper, phosphor-bronze, or Sn/Pb solder.






### What is the shelf life of HumiSeal® UV92?


12 months from date of manufacture when stored at 18 °C ± 10 °C in sealed containers.




### How do I clean tools after applying HumiSeal® UV92?


Use isopropyl alcohol to clean syringes, dispensers, or fixtures before the material is cured.






### What happens after shelf life?


Viscosity and cure performance can drift, risking incomplete cure or poor peel. For consistent results, do not use beyond stated shelf life. (General guidance based on TDS storage/shelf-life statements.)




### How do I cure HumiSeal® UV92?


Cure with UV-LED at 365 nm or 405 nm or with “H” type microwave/arc lamps at a minimum irradiance of 200 mW/cm². Ensure full exposure across the applied area.






### What thickness should I apply?


Apply up to 5 mm thickness to keep-out zones before coating, then UV-cure prior to conformal coating.




### How is it applied and removed?


Dispense by syringe or automated dispensing to the targeted areas, UV-cure, process the board, then peel off gently. No residue left to interfere with subsequent operations.






### What temperatures can it withstand?


Operating temperature range: −50 °C to +150 °C; it will also survive intermittent exposure up to 150 °C.




### Any safety or storage tips?


Use in well-ventilated areas and avoid skin/eye contact; consult the SDS. Store tightly closed at 8 °C–28 °C, away from sunlight or strong light sources.






### Is it compatible with metals and coatings?


Yes. It will not tarnish gold, tin, copper, phosphor bronze, or Sn/Pb solder, and it provides solvent resistance enabling selective release from conformal coatings after cure.








## Learn More About HumiSeal® UV92




HumiSeal® UV92 is a purpose-built, peelable mask for PCB manufacturing. Its thixotropic profile allows precise bead/dam formation by syringe or automated dispensing, then a fast UV cure locks it in place to keep contacts and connectors free of conformal coating. After processing, it peels away cleanly without residue—ideal for high-reliability assemblies that must remain testable and serviceable.




Key Features at a Glance



- ✔ Thixotropic, shear-thinning paste for precise dispensing

- ✔ UV cure (LED 365/405 nm or “H” lamps ≥200 mW/cm²)

- ✔ Excellent solvent resistance for selective release from coatings

- ✔ Peels cleanly; won’t tarnish common PCB metals

- ✔ Operating range −50 °C to +150 °C; intermittent 150 °C exposure

### Versatile Application Methods 🧰


HumiSeal® UV92 can be applied as a soft, peelable mask using syringes or automated dispensing equipment. Its thixotropic viscosity allows bead or dam formation, making it easy to control placement around connectors, test pads, and other keep-out zones.




Application Methods



- Syringe Dispensing: Ideal for localized application on connectors, pads, and edge fingers

- Automated Dispensing: For precise and repeatable coverage in production lines

- Bead/Dam Formation: Maintains shape during processing, even in thick applications (up to 5 mm)




Curing Options: 100% cured with UV exposure — UV-LED at 365 nm or 405 nm, or microwave/arc lamp systems (minimum 200 mW/cm²). Once cured, UV92 acts as a barrier to prevent conformal coating from entering protected areas. Removal is simple: peel away cleanly without residue.




Application Compatibility


HumiSeal® UV92 is compatible with a wide range of PCB materials and finishes, ensuring it can be safely used across diverse electronic assemblies:



- ✔ PCB assemblies and modules with conformal coatings

- ✔ Contact areas, connectors, and test points requiring protection

- ✔ Sensitive metals such as gold, tin, copper, phosphor bronze, and Sn/Pb solder (no tarnishing)




Its built-in UV tracer allows quick, accurate inspection under UV light to confirm full coverage before coating.







### Repairable and Reworkable 🔁


After processing, HumiSeal® UV92 can be peeled off cleanly without residue, allowing re-masking or rework as needed.




### Reliable Across Environments 🌍


Withstands temperatures from −50 °C to +150 °C and maintains performance during intermittent high-temperature exposure. Its solvent resistance ensures clean removal after exposure to harsh processes.
