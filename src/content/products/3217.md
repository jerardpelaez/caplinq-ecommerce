shortDescription: LOCTITE 3217 dual cure adhesive is designed for use in the assembly of temperature sensitive electronic components. The maximum performance of this material is achieved by exposure to UV light of sufficient intensity, followed by thermal cure. LOCTITE 3217 dual cure epoxy/acrylate (UV and heat) is an amber high viscosity material that is used for optical applications and the cavity fill of test IC's. It has good adhesion on glass and metals, based on customer experiences and it has been successfully used for Automotive applications.
