shortDescription: "Ultra-Thin Pressure Sensitive Polyimide Tape LINQTAPE™ PIT0.5S-UT Series tapes are our thinnest available high temperature tapes. It combines our 0.5-mil (13 micron) thick polyimide film – the generic equivalent of DuPont® Kapton™ HN tape – with an ultra-thin 0.5mil silicone pressure adhesive. This combination makes the PIT0.5S-UT-Series tapes our thinnest polymide products to date, with a total thickness of only 1 mil (25µm). Yet, it still has excellent adhesion and mechanical strength at high temperatures. Ultra-Thin, Flame Retardant Polyimide Tape LINQTAPE™ PIT0.5S-UT-Series tapes are high performance, temperature resistant polyimide tapes that use a polyimide film as a backing film. This backing film is the generic version of DuPont's Kapton HN film and is ultra-thin at 0.5mil (13µm) yet is just as flame retardant as its thicker counterparts. Laminated to this is a 0.5mil (13µm) thick pressure sensitive silicone adhesive making the total thickness of the polyimide film plus adhesive only 1mil (25µm) thick. PIT0.5S-UT Series remains both electrically and mechanically stable across temperatures ranging from -269°C to 400°C (-452°F to 752°F). CAPLINQ Linqfilm HN Polyimide Film is Versatile Linqfilm HN Polyimide is available as a stand-alone film (CAPLINQ Linqfilm PIT0.5N Series) in standard thicknesses of 0.5 mil (13 micron), 1 mil (25 micron), 2 mil (50 micron), 3 mil (75 micron) and 5 mil (125 micron). It is also available with specialty coatings applied to the tape such as a conductive polymer to make it antistatic, a sputtered aluminum coating, corona resistant, with a FEP fluoropolymer coating, or as a black polyimide version. Custom thicknesses and/or coatings may be available, please ask for more details. Once coated with the desired coating, it can be used as the backing film of many of our polyimide tapes which make it a pressure sensitive adhesive by applying either a silicone, rubber or acrylic adhesive layer. The adhesive layer is most often applied 1.5 mil (37 micron) thick, except in our thinnest product offerings which offers adhesive thicknesses as low as 0.5mil (13 micron) - this is our PIT0.5S-UT Series tapes. The adhesive may also be applied on one or both sides of the tape, and options are available to have it on a single or double-release, PET liner which makes it easier for handling or for the purpose of die-cut parts. Product Applications Polyimide tape is widely used in applications requiring high electrical insulation and an excellent balance of thermal, mechanical, chemical and electrical properties. As a base material, polyimide is extremely versatile as it can be die-cut, punched and thermoformed with or without adhesive. It is extremely well suited, and extensively used for wrapping cable and magnet wire. A further list of applications includes, but is not limited to aircraft and spacecraft wiring, insulation tubing, slot insulation, fiber optics cable, heater circuits, automotive diaphragms and manifolds, high temperature splicing and other applications that can make use of the ultra-thin, high temperature, electrically insulating properties of the PIT0.5S-UT polyimide HN tapes.
