shortDescription: LOCTITE ABLESTIK JM 7000 die attach adhesive has been formulated for use in high throughput die attach applications and hermetic packages. This material has been used successfully on rigid substrates with die sizes up to 700 mils. LOCTITE ABLESTIK JM 7000 is very stable in high temperatures and has been approved by DESC and Rome Laboratory for military products. LOCTITE ABLESTIK JM7000 is a cyanate ester, solvent-containing formulation so it will behave similarly to other Cyanate ester products.The degradation temperature, otherwise known as Onset decomposition temperature provided by the TGA for almost identical products shows decomposition of 0.3% at 400°C so JM7000 should be affected in a similar manner. Typical Cure Schedule 30 min @ 150°C For applications that require higher electrical conductivity, a cure cycle of 15min @ 300°C is recommended.

These products are old and so is the data accompanying them. Here is a TGA scan on an already cured JM7000 sample that shows that as the temperature increases the polymer starts to break down. Adhesion strength will start to decrease as the temperature increases approximately past 300°C and it's possible that this weight loss is indication of outgassing or decomposition. Please check the Technical documents section for a new(er) and full(er) data package.
