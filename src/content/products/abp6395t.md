shortDescription: LOCTITE ABLESTIK ABP 6395T is a silver, thermally and electrically conductive die attach adhesive for high-reliability package applications, typically SOIC, SOP, QFP and QFN packages. ABLESTIK ABP 6395T offers robust bonding of small to large die on a wide array of metal surfaces, including Cu, Ag and PPF lead frames, and is engineered to bond with or without BSM (Back Side Metallization) die. LOCTITE ABLESTIK ABP 6395T offers good thermal conductivity for heat management and excellent electrical conductivity to achieve low ON Resistance (RDS(ON)) in MOSFET devices. It’s formulated with an epoxy-based resin and cures when exposed to heat. Cure Schedule 30 minute ramp to 200°C + 30 minutes @ 200°C , in N2 or air

Recommended cure schedule



- 30 minute ramp to 200°C+30 minutes @200°C, in N2 or air.




Alternate cure schedule



- 30 minute ramp to 175°C+60 minutes @175°C, in N2 or air.




Thawing



- Allow container to reach room temperature before use.

- After removing from the freezer, set the syringes to stand vertically while thawing.

- Refer to the Syringe Thaw time chart for the thaw time recommendation.

- DO NOT open the container before contents reach 25°C temperature. Any moisture that collects on the thawed container should be removed prior to opening the container.

- DO NOT re-freeze. Once thawed to -40°C, the adhesive should not be re-frozen.






Direction for use



- Thawed material should immediately be placed on dispense equipment for use.

- If the adhesive is transferred to a final dispensing reservoir, care must be exercised to avoid entrapment of contaminants and/or air into the adhesive.

- Adhesive must be completely used within the product's recommended work life.

- Silver-resin separation may occur if the adhesive is left out at room temperature, beyond the recommended work life.

- Apply enough adhesive to achieve a 25 to 50µm wet bondline thickness, dispensed with approximately 25 to 50% filleting on all sides of the die.

- Alternate dispense amounts may be used depending on the application requirements.

- Star or crossed shaped dispense patterns will yield fewer bondline voids than the matrix style of dispense pattern.
