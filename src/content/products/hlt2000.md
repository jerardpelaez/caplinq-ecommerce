shortDescription: Honeywell HLT2000 is a two-part, dispensable thermally conductive gel, which offers long-term reliability and superior softness for a competitive value proposition. The enhanced bonding force between the polymer base and the filler largely improves the thermally conductive gel oil separation issue in storage. Prior to curing, the material maintains good thixotropic characteristics and low viscosity to be easily dispensed. Honeywell HLT2000 can be cured in short time after two-component mixing at room temperature. The high compressibility minimizes thermal resistance at interfaces, while maintaining excellent performance during reliability testing. It has high dispense rate, above 100 g/min and low outgassing, below 0.5%. HLT 2000 has excellent thermal stability after different long term reliability tests including, D85( 85°C&85%RH) 1000hrs, Thermal Shock 1000cycles and HTB(High Temperature Baking) 125°C 1000hrs. The product can be cured at either 10 hours at Room temperature or 30 minutes at 100°C. Of course those are just indications and you can experiment with curing for your application needs.
