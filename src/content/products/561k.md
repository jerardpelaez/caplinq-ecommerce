shortDescription: LOCTITE ABLESTIK 561K is a white epoxy film designed for substrate attach and heat sink bonding. This adhesive film is designed for bonding materials with severely mismatched coefficients of thermal expansion. All data and results will vary with different thicknesses. LOCTITE ABLESTIK 561K is a reworkable assembly film that passes NASA outgassing standards. If you require a low temperature cure you can consider LOCTITE ABLESTIK 566K. It is mainly used for substrate attach and heat sink bonding and has a glass fabric carrier. Cure Schedule 30min @150°C 2 hours @ 125°C

### How does ABLESTIK 561K compares to ABLESTIK 566K?


The storage temperature of both materials is as low as -40 °C to guarantee its material properties over a longer range of time. The 561K is a great reference material that can be stored at -40 °C for 12 months but can also be stored at ambient (25 °C) for up to 6 months without loss of performance. The difference with 561K however, in the higher minimum cure schedule of 125 °C for 2 hours. The 566K material can cure at 100 °C but this is achieved by an increased catalyst load making the material more reactive, giving it shorter shelf life. (We would expect -20 °C storage to be sufficient for the 566K for 3-6 months)


Essentially you end up with two options:



- Use 561K with 6 months storage at 25 °C and accept a higher 125 °C cure

- Use 566K with 3-6 months storage at -20 °C and cure at 100 °C
