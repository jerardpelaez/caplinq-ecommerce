shortDescription: Thermelt 865 Black is a solvent-free, non-reactive copolymer polyamide hot melt resin developed specifically for low pressure molding (LPM) applications. With excellent adhesion properties and a robust thermal and mechanical profile, it is ideal for overmolding and encapsulation of sensitive electronic components, connectors, and cable assemblies. This resin offers outstanding low-temperature flexibility, strong mechanical resilience, and UL94 V-0 flammability rating, making it well-suited for applications where protection against environmental factors, electrical insulation, and mechanical stress are essential.
