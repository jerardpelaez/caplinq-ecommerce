shortDescription: "LINQBOND SO-332CM is a tin-free, dibutyltin (DBT)/dioctyltin (DOT) compound-free, moisture-curing modified silicone adhesive. This formulation uses alkoxy functional groups for ambient air moisture-initiated curing. Its isocyanate-free resin system makes this adhesive more sustainable and minimal odor profile. SO-332CM has better adhesion strength relative to conventional silicone-based products, making it suitable for critical casting and bonding tasks within the 3C industry. Product Key Features: Moisture-Curing Mechanism: Cures via reaction with atmospheric moisture, eliminating the need for external heat or initiators. Rapid Curing Kinetics: Achieves functional cure properties quickly, optimizing production cycle times. Superior Adhesion Strength: Exhibits enhanced bonding capabilities compared to conventional silicone-based adhesives. Optimized for 3C Industry: Specifically formulated for critical casting and bonding applications within the Computer, Communications, and Consumer Electronics (3C) sector. Applications Component assembly and sealing Critical bonding of internal components and sub-assemblies"

Directions for Use



- Apply to a clean surface which should be free of dirt, grease or mold release. In many cases, a simple solvent wipe is sufficient.

- Pour or brush this product onto the substrates. It is not recommend to stir it onto the substrates to avoid formation of air bubbles. This product will be cured through air-drying but propeties depend on its thickness, curing temperatrue, and relative humidity.

- After bonding, do not move the substrate for 1 to 2 hours. It is expected to partially cure after 12 to 24 hours. If the layer is thick, the initial curing time will be longer.

- Use this product as soon as possible after opening the original package. When not in use, please replace the lid tightly and store in a cool and dry place.

- Cure time depends on part geometry, materials to be bonded, bondline thickness, and humidity. Cure schedule should be in accordance with actual specifications of production parts and equipment.
