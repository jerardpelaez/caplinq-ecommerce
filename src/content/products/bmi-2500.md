shortDescription: BMI-2500 has been designed to extend the range of applications suitable for use with the Designer Molecules, Inc. imide extended bismaleimide oligomers to those in need of higher Tg and modulus. The material has excellent low pH hydrolytic resistance and thermal stability. As an additive it can improve rheological properties by increasing the thixotropic properties of a liquid monomer composition. This feature in turn can help to reduce resin bleed out on a variety of surfaces. It is soluble in most aromatic and aliphatic solvents such as toluene, xylene, NMP, etc. It can be processed in a resin system as a solid or dissolved in a solvent. BMI-2500 is recommended for use as an additive to increase flexibility, hydrophobicity and thixotropy. When used as a base resin, it can produce films that are tough, flexible and demonstrate good peel strength. BMI-2500 is compatible with PPE and Acrylates for free radical reaction and epoxy with anionic cure.
