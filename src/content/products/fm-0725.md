FM-0725 is suitable for use in UV curing systems but is not specifically designed to enhance adhesion. However, its silicone component may contribute to increased flexibility in the resin, which could indirectly influence adhesion performance.


In some systems, the long silicone chain of FM-0725 may present compatibility challenges. In such cases, using a version with a shorter molecular weight may be more effective, though it would offer a more limited improvement in flexibility.
