shortDescription: A-478-M is a versatile additive for adhesion enhancement. The combination of methacrylate groups and carboxylic acid groups per molecule allow bonding to a variety of surfaces. A-478-M is recommended for use as an adhesion-enhancing additive. DMI has developed a proprietary method of producing a mixed isomer version of the popular PMDM adhesion promoter while still retaining the appearance of the original PMDM. This new process has significantly higher yields and produces a material that can be offered at significant price reductions for your dental adhesive needs.
