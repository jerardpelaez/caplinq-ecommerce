shortDescription: "LINQCELL GDP090 is an ultrathin, 90-µm thick graphitized carbon fiber paper without a microporous layer, made from high-quality polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers. The fibers undergo a wet-laying paper process to form a non-woven, fibrous, and porous structure, which is then carbonized and graphitized at an exceptionally high temperature of 2000 °C. This high graphitization temperature significantly improves electrical conductivity, thermal stability, and oxidation resistance. Key Features: Ultra-thin Profile: At just 90 µm (0.09 mm), GDP090 minimizes stack volume, enabling compact fuel cell designs without compromising performance. High-Temperature Graphitization: Graphitized at an elevated temperature of 2000 °C, this carbon fiber paper has a highly-crystalline graphite-like structure, enhancing conductivity, thermal stability, and oxidation resistance for demanding applications. No MPL and PTFE Layer: Enables direct control of interfacial modifications for system-specific optimization in fuel cells and electrochemical devices. The improved properties of LINQCELL GDP090 make it highly suitable for use as anode and cathode gas diffusion layers in fuel cells. Its ultra-thin design reduces stack volume, enhancing overall fuel cell efficiency by minimizing internal resistance. Additionally, its low thickness combined with high permeability makes it ideal for high humidity fuel cell operation (≥60%) at temperatures between 50 to 80°C. In medium humidity conditions (20 to 60%), LINQCELL GDP090 performs effectively at lower temperatures (≤50°C), covering stable and efficient fuel cell operation across a wide range of humidity and temperature conditions. Highly Recommended As: Gas diffusion layers of fuel cells, particularly proton exchange membrane fuel cells Gas diffusion substrates of carbon dioxide electrolyzer electrodes Recommended For Fuel Cells Operating at: High humidity (≥60%) at temperatures between 50 to 80 °C Medium relative humidity (20 to 60%) at low temperatures ≤50 °C"
