## Product Description

LinQTherm TCP-100 is a soft, highly conformable thermal conductive pad designed to provide an efficient thermal pathway between heat-generating components and heat sinks, chassis, or other cooling structures. With a thermal conductivity of 3.0 W/mK and a Shore 00 hardness of just 25, the TCP-100 conforms readily to surface irregularities and fills gaps with minimal mounting pressure, making it ideal for applications where component height tolerances vary.

The TCP-100 is manufactured from a silicone elastomer matrix loaded with thermally conductive ceramic fillers. It is supplied as pre-cut sheets or custom die-cut shapes with a tacky surface on both sides that holds the pad in position during assembly without the need for additional adhesive. The pad is available in thicknesses ranging from 0.5 to 5.0 mm, enabling it to bridge gaps of varying sizes within a single PCB assembly.

Electrically insulating with a dielectric strength of 12 kV/mm, the TCP-100 provides both thermal management and electrical isolation in a single material. It is inherently flame retardant (UL 94 V-0 rated) and meets all RoHS and REACH requirements. The TCP-100 is a drop-in solution that simplifies assembly, reduces component stress, and ensures consistent thermal performance across high-volume production.

## Key Features

- 3.0 W/mK thermal conductivity with excellent conformability
- Ultra-soft Shore 00 25 for minimal component stress
- Available in 0.5 to 5.0 mm thicknesses
- Naturally tacky surfaces eliminate need for adhesive
- High dielectric strength (12 kV/mm) for electrical isolation
- UL 94 V-0 flame retardant rating
- Easy die-cut processing for custom shapes

## Applications

LinQTherm TCP-100 is used extensively in consumer electronics, automotive electronics, and telecommunications equipment where thermal interface pads must fill gaps between components of varying height and the enclosure or heat sink. Typical applications include transferring heat from memory modules, voltage regulators, chipsets, and power stages to metal enclosures in set-top boxes, routers, and automotive ECUs. The TCP-100 is also used in battery management systems for electric vehicles, where it fills the gaps between cylindrical or pouch cells and the cooling plate to ensure uniform thermal management across the battery pack.
