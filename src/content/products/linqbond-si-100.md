## Product Description

LinQBond SI-100 is a one-component, room-temperature vulcanizing (RTV) silicone adhesive and sealant designed for flexible bonding, sealing, and environmental protection of electronic assemblies. Its moisture-cure mechanism requires no mixing or metering -- simply dispense from the cartridge or tube and allow ambient humidity to initiate cross-linking. The SI-100 becomes tack-free in 15 minutes and reaches full cure within 24 hours, forming a resilient elastomeric bond that absorbs stress, vibration, and thermal expansion mismatch.

The cured SI-100 maintains its flexibility and adhesion across an exceptionally wide temperature range of -60 to 250 °C, making it one of the most thermally versatile adhesives in the CAPLINQ portfolio. With an elongation at break of 350%, it accommodates the differential thermal expansion between dissimilar materials such as aluminum heat sinks and FR-4 PCBs without cracking or delamination. Its clear color and optical transparency make it particularly well suited for LED and optical assemblies.

The SI-100 provides excellent resistance to UV radiation, ozone, moisture, and weathering, ensuring long-term durability in outdoor and harsh-environment applications. It is UL-recognized, meets the requirements of MIL-A-46106, and is available in standard cartridges, tubes, and bulk packaging for both manual and automated dispensing. Its neutral (non-corrosive) cure chemistry makes it safe for use with sensitive electronics, including copper, silver, and tin-plated surfaces.

## Key Features

- One-component moisture-cure requires no mixing
- 15-minute tack-free time for rapid assembly
- Exceptional flexibility with 350% elongation at break
- Ultra-wide operating range: -60 to 250 °C
- Clear, optically transparent for LED and optical use
- Neutral cure chemistry safe for sensitive electronics
- Excellent UV, ozone, and weathering resistance

## Applications

LinQBond SI-100 is used as a sealing and gasketing material for electronic enclosures, sensor housings, and connector assemblies where environmental protection against moisture, dust, and chemicals is required. It serves as a flexible adhesive for bonding LED lenses to heat sinks, securing optical fibers, and attaching flexible circuits to rigid substrates. In automotive electronics, the SI-100 is used for sealing ECU housings, bonding and vibration-dampening of sensitive components, and form-in-place gasketing for IP67-rated assemblies.
