shortDescription: "LOCTITE STYCAST OS 5101 is specially formulated for use in optical component assembly applications. This product is designed with a secondary thermal cure mechanism for applications with shadowed areas where light is unable to penetrate. LOCTITE STYCAST OS 5101 is a dual cure, active alignment adhesive designed for the demands of 100 GbE and 400 GbE optical transceivers and ROADM switches used in cloud- and hyperscale datacenters. The material ensures accurate lens, component and fiber alignment, which is critical to signal integrity for high-speed data transmission. It can be used for TO-CAN pre-fix, lens, fiber, glass, and other optical components requiring active alignment or pre-fixing. LOCTITE STYCAST OS 5101 combines UV and thermal cure mechanisms to precisely align and bond optical lenses, components and fibers so that light transmittance is maximized and positional integrity is maintained while in operation. With excellent dimensional stability, low shrinkage and strong adhesion to multiple surfaces, LOCTITE STYCAST OS 5101 delivers reliable performance for next-generation optical devices. LOCTITE STYCAST OS 5101 is based on a robust epoxy resin system and shows ~0.2% weight loss by cure shrinkage and ~0.6% weight loss after UV/120C cure by TGA. This is comparable level to NASA Outgassing approved encapsulants with typically Cure Schedule Light Source LED lamp Wavelength, nm 365 Light Intensity, mW/cm² 120 to 250 Exposure Time, seconds 60 to 120 Secondary thermal cure: 60 to 120 minutes @ 120°C Onset temperature is 99°C and the lowest curing profile is 90-120 minutes @ 100°C (We suggest longer 120min for an optimum cure)"
