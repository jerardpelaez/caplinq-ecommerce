shortDescription: MM-304 is a liquid mono-functional methacrylate monomer. It has similar properties as Isobornyl Methacrylate (IBOMA) when polymerized but with lower weight loss on cure. It has a mild, pleasant odor. MM-304 has good resistance to hydrolysis. MM-304 is recommended as a reactive diluent monomer for use in UV or peroxide cure formulations. It is particularly recommended for applications that require hydrolytic resistance.
