Cure Conditions



- 4–6 hours at @25°Cthen 1 hour at 60–80 °C or

- 4–5 days at @25°C








Processing Instructions





Before mixing, stir both Part A and Part B to homogenize.




Mix components A and B according to the specified weight ratio. Stir thoroughly to ensure uniformity while preventing air from being introduced into the mixture. Ensure contamination is avoided.




To ensure complete mixing of both parts, machine mixing and dispensing are recommended. Static and dynamic mixer can also be used.




Degas the mixture to remove the bubbles for about 10 minutes. Do not fill the container more than half full to prevent overflowing during degassing.




Gradually pour the mixed compound into the device being potted.




Allow the potted workpiece cure at 30°C until the surface is dry. Full curing typically occurs within 24 hours. The curing process is influenced by temperature variations; generally, higher temperatures result in faster curing, while lower temperatures lead to slower curing.







Precautions





Use the mixture promptly after combining components A and B to prevent a significant increase in viscosity.




If the components have been stored for an extended period and exhibit precipitation or stratification, they should be thoroughly mixed before use.







Packaging


Part A is available in 25 kg open top plastic bucket. Part B is available in 250 kg metal barrels or 40 and 24 kg plastic cans.




Storage and Handling


Store in a ventilated, dry, and clean environment at 25°C–40°C Keep away from fire and heat sources. It is strictly forbidden to store in outdoor environments. At proper storage conditions, Part A has a shelf life of 6 months and Part B has a shelf life of 12 months.
