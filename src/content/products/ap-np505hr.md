shortDescription: "KESTER NP505-HR is a zero-halogen, lead-free, no-clean solder paste formula developed specifically for high reliability applications. NP505-HR has been formulated to have reliable residues even in harsh damp cycling SIR testing. NP505-HR can handle a wide variety of printer variables, including print speed and long idle times with a wide range of temperatures and humidities. NP505-HR is fully capable of printing and reflowing 01005 components in air reflow with minimal graping behavior. Post-soldering, NP505-HR offers minimized defects, including head-in-pillow and QFN/BGA voiding. This paste is zero-halogen, exceeding the IPC definition for halogen-free. NP505-HR is classified as ROL0 per IPC J-STD-004B. NP505-HR is part of Kester&rsquo;s high reliability product line and compatible with no-clean RF550 Rework Flux, NF372-TB Solder Flux and SELECT-10&trade; Selective Soldering Flux. Product Key Features Exceeds IPC standards for halogen-free materials Designed to maintain reliability even under harsh damp cycling SIR (Surface Insulation Resistance) testing. Supports printing and reflowing of 01005 components with minimal graping in air reflow environments. Minimizes common soldering defects such as head-in-pillow & QFN/BGA voiding Classified as ROL0 per IPC J-STD-004B Applications Solder printing Fully compatible with: RF550 Rework Flux NF372-TB Solder Flux SELECT-10&trade; Selective Soldering Flux"

### NP505-HR Reflow Profile

The general recommended convection reflow profile for NP505-HR formula made with SAC and Innolot alloys is shown here as a starting point. Your final profile will depend on your board mass and component combination. NP505-HR has excellent solderability and wetting capabilities in air or nitrogen reflow atmospheres. Your optimal profile may be different from the basic graph.

Please contact us if you need profiling advice.

#### SAC Alloys Relow Profile

Preheat Zone

- Temperature range: Room temperature to ~150&deg;C

- Duration: 60&ndash;120 seconds

- Purpose: Gradual heating to reduce thermal shock and activate flux.

Soak Zone

- Temperature range: 150&deg;C to ~200&deg;C

- Duration: 60&ndash;120 seconds

- Purpose: Ensures uniform heating and activates flux chemistry.

Reflow Zone

- Peak Temperature: 235&ndash;250&deg;C

- Time above liquidus (TAL): 30&ndash;60 seconds

- Purpose: Achieves full solder reflow and wetting.

Cooling Zone

- Controlled cooling after peak temperature to prevent thermal stress and defects.
