shortDescription: Kester 186 Rosin Flux is a high-performance formula developed for critical soldering applications, even on difficult assemblies, where process requirements mandate a Type RMA (Rosin Mildly Activated) flux. It meets requirements for MIL-F-14256 and provides fluxing ability approaching that of Type RA flux. Kester 186 is engineered for reliability, possessing high thermal stability suitable for soldering multi-layer assemblies that require high preheat temperatures. Its residue offers superior electrical and environmental properties, making it acceptable for many no-clean applications. Product Key Features Maintains performance and residue solubility even after exposure to high preheat temperatures for multi-layer soldering. Causes no surface insulation resistance (SIR) degradation. Non-corrosive and non-conductive. No-clean compatible Applications Designed for use in applications where difficult assemblies must be soldered but an RMA flux type is required. Ideal for soldering complex multi-layer electronic assemblies requiring high preheat temperatures.

### Flux Application

186 can be applied to circuit boards by a foam or dip process. An air knife after the flux tank is recommended tp remove excess flux from the circuit board and prevent dripping on the preheated surface. A spray application can be used if the spray system can handle a high solids flux (36%).
