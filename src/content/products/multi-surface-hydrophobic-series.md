category: repellency-treatments
subcategory: repellency-treatments
sellingPoints:
  - General purpose hydrophobic treatment
  - 20-100 nm thickness
  - Repels most aqueous liquids
shortDescription: Aculon's Multi-Surface Hydrophobic technology is designed to make many surfaces repellent to water and other water-based fluids. The hydrophobic treatment is quick and easy to apply, optically clear, and ultra-thin. It can reach a thickness anywhere from 20 nm to 100 nm and reduces the friction of the surface without altering its appearance. Aculon's Multi-Surface Hydrophobic Treatment can even be applied via several application methods that do not require capital equipment investments, including dip, wipe, or spray. Advantages of Aculon's Multi-Surface Hydrophobic Treatment Repels liquids from many different metals, polymers, textiles, paper, etc. Lowers the coefficient of friction of surfaces Uniform thickness General purpose and multi-surface treatment Easily reapplied in the field if damaged/reworkable

### How to apply Aculon's Multi Surface Hydrophobic Treatment






STEP 1 ⇨ CLEAN




STEP 2 ⇨ TREAT




STEP 3 ⇨ DRY








For this technology, cleaning is not typically required but is recommended. To clean, remove any visual dust, dirt, and grime that could damage the surface.




Dip - Fully immerse the part in the treatment solution for 1 minute. Withdraw the part at a steady rate to ensure even coverage. Allow to dry or cure, then wipe clean with a microfiber cloth.






Air dry at room temperature until the surface is dry to the touch.


In some cases, additional thermal curing (e.g. 100°C for 5 minutes) may boost performance.










Wipe - Using a clean cotton cloth, wet it with the solution then rub the substrate for 10 seconds, air dry, then wipe clean with a microfiber cloth.






Spray - Spray the solution on the substrate, air dry. If the coating is too thick, reduce the amount applied by changing the settings on the spray gun or using a diluent.










### Application Tips



- In some cases, additional thermal curing ( e.g. 100°C for 5 minutes) may boost performance.

- Inkjet printing or roll coating can also be used to apply the treatment.

- Spray Equipment Suggestions: HVLP(Binks Mach 1), HVLP(Devilbiss JGHV), Air Atomization(Devilbiss MBC gun), and Airless(Graco Model 225-292 President Pump Series A).








### How to test for Hydrophobicity


To test for hydrophobicity, allow water droplets to fall onto the surface, which should bead up to a contact angle >90⁰. If the contact angle is
