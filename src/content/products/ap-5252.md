### Application

5252 can be used as a solvent for the following applications: stencil cleaning, cleaning of misprinted assemblies, removal of post-soldering flux residues and other organic contaminants from electronic assemblies (wave-soldered and reflow processes), and general purpose cleaning.

5252 may be used at ambient temperature with ultrasonics, stencil spray equipment, or immersion agitation or manual application. When the residue has completely dissolved and is no longer visible, the residual solution is rinsed off with more solvent. The purpose is not to only dissolve the residue, but also to remove it after it is dissolved.

5252 dries fast and usually does not require any water rinse. It is recommended that after cleaning with 5252 solvent, the stencils or electronic assemblies should be dried by evaporation or solvent displacement with forced air. If additional cleanliness is required, the stencils or assemblies could be rinsed with a secondary 5252 rinse. The bath life of the cleaner solvent will depend on the cleanliness requirements. The solvent should be replaced at regular intervals in order to avoid solvent contamination.
