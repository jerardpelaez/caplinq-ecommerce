shortDescription: Honeywell's TGP8000HV is a Thermally Conductive Gap Pad which offers a good combination of low thermal impedance, high breakdown voltage and ease of use across multitude of applications. The naturally tacky property avoids the use of additional adhesive which could inhibit thermal performance. Honeywell's TGP8000HV Thermal Gap Pads (TGP) have the lowest Thermal impedance out of all the entire thermal gap pad portfolio, plus higher breakdown voltage than the plain TGP8000 version. This and the hardness (30 vs 60 on shore00) are the main differentiating factors between the two. Their ultra-high compressibility enables low stress and excellent conformity to mating surfaces. They are designed to minimize thermal resistance at interfaces, and maintain excellent performance through reliability testing. Honeywell's TGP8000HV ,in addition to High breakdown voltage, exhibits low oil bleeding and outgassing along with low hardness. The bleeding will depend on the pressure differential, the amount of uncross-linked silicone in the pad and the molecular weight of those unlinked chains. Available formats for TGP8000HV include standard sheets and custom die-cut parts that are available in a thickness range from 0.5mm to 5.0mm.
