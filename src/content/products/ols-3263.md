shortDescription: "Optically Clear Two-Part Dimethyl Silicone LED Liquid Encapsulant OPTOLINQ OLS-3263 is a two-part (Part A & Part B), optically clear dimethyl silicone designed for the encapsulation of mid- and high-power LEDs. It features a very good heat resistance, high optical transmittance and excellent resistance to both UV and heat resistance in applications as high as 170&deg;C. Dimethyl-type silicones are known to have an even higher optical transmittance and wide processing windows. It also has a high level of adhesion to a wide-range of metals, silicones and plastics and to PPA in particular. OLS-3263 can be dispensed from standard dispensing equipment or can also be compression molded using compression mold equipment. Main Features Two-part, optically clear dimethyl silicone for LED encapsulation High optical transmittance with a wide processing window (dimethyl silicone platform) Excellent UV + heat resistance for demanding light and thermal exposure environments High-temperature capability in applications up to 170&deg;C Strong adhesion to many metals, plastics, and silicones; excellent adhesion to PPA Scalable processing: compatible with standard dispensing and compression molding Phosphor compatible (supports mixing for die-level color conversion) Applications OLS-3263 is specially designed for mid- and high-power LED devices, particularly where operating temperatures are higher and long-life reliability is critical, including: Automotive lighting (high-temperature, vibration, long service life) Industrial bay lights (warehouses, high ambient temperatures) Street lighting / outdoor luminaires (thermal + environmental exposure) High-power projectors / beamers (high intensity, long throw requirements) Mid/high-power LED modules requiring clear encapsulation and robust adhesion Phosphor-mixed encapsulation for die-level color conversion"

## OPTOLINQ Family series

CAPLINQ OPTOLINQ&trade; OLS-Series are a family of optically clear (often called &ldquo;water-white&rdquo;) liquid encapsulants that are used to encapsulate optical or optoelectronic devices that require both a high level of light transmittance as well as a good level of mechanical protection. Products in this OLS-Series family can be epoxies, silicones or hybrid technologies. They are used extensively for the encapsulation of LED devices, but could be well suited for other applications that require a clear, optical grade encapsulation system.

The OPTOLINQ OLS Series is CAPLINQ&rsquo;s Opto Liquid System (OLS) series and is made up of several families of products that each have their own unique attributes and application-specific benefits.

## OPTOLINQ Family Series

The OPTOLINQ OLS Series is CAPLINQ&rsquo;s Opto Liquid System (OLS) series and is made up of several families of products that each have their own unique attributes and application-specific benefits.

## Main Applications

- Mid-power LED Encapsulation

- High-power LED Encapsulation

- Compression Molding LED devices

- Compression molding opto lenses

## Product Features & Benefits:

- Temperatures up to 170&deg;C

- Excellent adhesion to PPA

- Excellent Heat Stability

- Excellent UV stability

## Additional Handling Instructions

Preheat Part A to 40&deg;C and then mix in Part B in the required mixing ratio given above. Ideally, the mixture of Part A and B will be done in a vacuum and degassed at 3 torr (400 Pa) for 10-15 minutes. This will ensure that all the entrapped air bubbles are removed after mixing. For best results, ensure that all moisture has been removed from the parts to be encapsulated by preheating them for 1 hour @ 90&deg;C. Also for best results, the encapsulation should be carried out in a vacuum.

## Using Additives with OLS-3263

Optolinq OLS-3263 can be mixed with diffusing agents or color pastes to achieve customer-specific purposes.

Recommended quantity (in weight %) of various diffusing agents and color pastes to be used with OLS-3263:

- OAA1-2 Red Color Paste: 2-5% by weight

- OAA1-3 Blue Color Paste: 1-3% by weight

- OAA1-4 Green Color Paste: 2-4% by weight

- OAA1-D Diffusing Agent: 2-5% by weight

## Storage and Handling

OPTOLINQ OLS-3263 is supplied in cans and jars and should be kept in a cool (10&deg;C &ndash; 25&deg;C) dry place (40% &ndash; 75% humidity) away from direct sunlight or temperature extremes. Part B is particularly sensitive to moisture, so be sure to remove moisture after using and to keep the lid of the container tightly sealed after use.

For safe handling information on this product, consult the Safety Data Sheet, (SDS).
