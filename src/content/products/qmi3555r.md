subcategory: die-attach-pastes
sellingPoints:
  - Wide processing window
  - Low temperature profile
  - Low stress on die
shortDescription: LOCTITE ABLESTIK QMI 3555R is a low temperature processing, no dry, silver glass die attach adhesive for the attachment of integrated circuits in both solder seal and glass seal hermetic packages. It is designed for fast firing large die or small dies on either gold plated or bare ceramic substrates. The paste fires into a film that provides high thermal and electrical conductivity as well as excellent initial adhesion. It is extremely resistant to degradation during temperature cycling from -65°C to +150°C. LOCTITE ABLESTIK QMI 3555R incorporates a patented silver/vanadium glass. Sub-350°C firing enhances the reliability of devices fabricated with sub-micron design rules. Also, in cofired package applications, nickel diffusion through gold plated seal rings and leadfinger pads are minimized at lower temperatures. QMI3555R low stress allows for a thin bondline, offering improved thermal performance for high power devices. LOCTITE ABLESTIK QMI 3555R can be fired at temperatures between 300°C and 450°C on bare ceramic. On gold plated parts, the minimum peak should be 325°C. The minimum dwell time should be at least 14 minutes above 300°C when the peak is Compared to LOCTITE ABLESTIK QMI 3555, the R in QMI 3555R stands for RESIN, so the QMI 3555R (resin) version contains ~0.1% by weight of resin added over QMI3555 to slow down solvent drying. Technically both products have comparable properties after cure.

What is the difference between QMI3555 and QMI3555R? The R stands for RESIN, so the QMI 3555R (resin) version contains ~0.1% by weight of resin added over QMI3555 to slow down solvent drying. Technically both products have comparable properties after cure.


QMI 3555R can be fired at temperatures between 300°C and 450°C on bare ceramic. On gold plated parts, the minimum peak should be 325°C. The minimum dwell time should be at least 14 minutes above 300°C when the peak is Now – mix/degas the material in the syringe using "centrifuging equipment" as described below



- Thinky ARE-250 or ARE-310 mixer (available from Intertronics) or a “Speedmixer” from Synergy Devices would work well

- Vacuum versions of these mixers should be available, which will work better than non-vacuum versions but may not be needed

- The process takes about 5 mins, but parameters should be optimized by DOE at the customers' site




- Check the syringe, and push the piston down onto the surface of the QMI 3555R, if it lifted during the degassing

- The syringe is now ready to use and should be used within the same shift to prevent the settling of the silver in the syringe (or centrifuge again prior to use)




Such (vacuum) centrifuging equipment is commonly used in semiconductor back-end assembly.




### Why do I need a jar roller?


There are numerous options available on the market, including single jar and multiple jar rollers. The primary purpose of using a jar roller is to homogenize the silver/glass paste prior to use. As specified on the TDS: "upon receipt, the paste must be immediately placed on a jar roller and continuously rolled for a minimum of 16 hours before opening the jar".


There are no specific brands recommended, the most important is to achieve the homogeneity of the paste before its use.
