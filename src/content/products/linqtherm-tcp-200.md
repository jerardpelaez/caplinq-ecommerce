## Product Description

LinQTherm TCP-200 is a high-performance thermal conductive pad engineered for demanding applications where elevated thermal conductivity and long-term reliability are essential. Featuring a thermal conductivity of 5.0 W/mK, the TCP-200 delivers significantly enhanced heat transfer compared to standard thermal pads, making it the material of choice for power electronics modules, automotive inverters, and high-density computing platforms.

The TCP-200 is based on a reinforced silicone matrix filled with advanced ceramic particles, including aluminum nitride, to achieve its elevated thermal performance. A fiberglass reinforcement layer provides exceptional handling strength and tear resistance, enabling automated pick-and-place processing while maintaining the compliance needed to conform to typical surface roughness. The pad is available in thicknesses from 0.25 to 3.0 mm with tight tolerance control.

Built for harsh environments, the TCP-200 operates reliably from -50 to 200 °C and withstands the aggressive thermal cycling encountered in automotive under-hood and aerospace applications. It exhibits minimal compression set over time, ensuring that thermal performance is maintained throughout the product lifetime. The TCP-200 is UL 94 V-0 rated and complies with RoHS, REACH, and key automotive material specifications.
