shortDescription: "DK15-0907 Red is an epoxy-based, \"One Powder Solution\" coating powder developed for low and medium voltage (600V - 38,000V) bus bars. Used for over 20 years by major power distribution companies for low and medium-voltage bus bar applications, DK15-0907 provides a smooth surface appearance with high edge coverage. The fusion bonded coating is smooth, tough, and moisture-resistant for applications up to 38 KV. DK15-0907 is UL recognized for UL94-V0 rating and meets the UL746B Relative Thermal Index (RTI) of 130°C and is currently on test for an RTI at or above 150°C. Rapid and thick build reduces production cycle times. Particle size is optimized for the fluidized bed coating process. Advantages of DK15-0907 for Busbar Coating Suitable for copper and aluminum bar Smooth, uniform coating build in excess of 200 mils (5 mm) Rapid build rates to reduce cycle times Fine grind powder to replenish size distribution Fluidizing agent to promote uniform build Ongoing testing to optimize quality & productivity Typical applications and uses of DK15-0907 include: Low Voltage (600V) Copper, Aluminum and Brass Busbars Medium Voltage (up to 38kV) Copper, Aluminum and Brass Busbars Switchgear Equipment for Power Distribution This product is no longer available. Some alternatives for busbar coating powders are: BCP-1509 Medium to high voltage insulation BCP-1507 One powder solution for all BCP-1504 Low voltage busbars BCP-1000 Low cost spray coating"
