shortDescription: ABChimie&reg; 6025UV LED is a soft, transparent resin coating designed to provide mechanical and environmental protection to electronic components and assemblies. Its thixotropic quality allows for controlled application with high thicknesses (up to 4mm) without sagging. The resin is soft, which allows it to absorb shock easily. These qualities make it ideal for encapsulation or localized protection in applications where shock absorption is required. ABChimie&reg; 6025UV LED is acrylic-based and has excellent adhesion to many substrates, including flexible ones like plastics. One of its advantages is that it cures rapidly under UV LED light (395 nm), has zero VOCs, and can be applied to high-speed manufacturing processes to increase productivity. ABChimmie 6025UV LED is in full compliance with REACH and RoHS regulations. Product Key Features Transparent, thixotropic UV-curing resin Shock absorbing Allows for thick, controlled application without sagging Fast UV cure for high-sp Solvent-free formulation (no VOCs) LED Curing for worker / environmental safety Applications Encapsulation of electronic components requiring high volumes, localized protection, and a thick coating Sensors on PCBs, wire-bonded chips, and reinforcement of solder joints. Can be used to seal plastic casings on PCBs. Ideal for applications that might be exposed to impacts, drops, or vibrations. Printed circuit assemblies.

## Frequently Asked Questions About ABChimie&reg; 6025 UV LED

### What are typical applications for ABChimie&reg; 6025 UV LED?

ABChimie&reg; 6025 UV led is an LED UV-curable resin designed to protect printed circuit board assemblies (PCBs) and components in demanding manufacturing environments, including:

- Automotive electronics (e.g., control units, sensors)

- Industrial automation (e.g., motor drives, PLCs)

- Consumer electronics (e.g., smart devices, wearables)

- Other high-reliability electronic assemblies

### Why choose ABChimie&reg; 6025 UV LED?

ABChimie&reg; 6025 UV LED delivers rapid LED UV curing, excellent electrical insulation, thixotropic application properties, and strong adhesion to flexible substrates. It supports high-throughput manufacturing while providing durable protection for sensitive components.

### What is the shelf life of ABChimie&reg; 6025 UV LED?

ABChimie&reg; 6025 UV LED has a shelf life of 12 months when stored at 5&ndash;30&deg;C in tightly sealed containers. Prior to use, allow the product to equilibrate for 24 hours at 18&ndash;32&deg;C for optimal performance.

### What happens after the shelf life?

Using ABChimie&reg; 6025 UV LED past its shelf life may alter viscosity, affecting uniformity and application performance. Always use an in-date product for reliable results.

### What is the recommended curing method for ABChimie&reg; 6025 UV LED?

ABChimie&reg; 6025 UV LED is UV-curable and should be cured with a mercury lamp. The minimum UVA dose is 1000 mJ/cm&sup2; for a 1mm thickness. The mercury lamp-curable version is ABChimie&reg; 6025 UV. Higher UVA doses do not negatively affect final properties.

### What is the maximum thickness for ABChimie&reg; 6025 UV LED?

ABChimie&reg; 6025 UV LED can be applied up to 4mm due to its thixotropic properties, allowing high-thickness deposits without sagging.

### What safety precautions should I take?

Use ABChimie&reg; 6025 UV LED in a well-ventilated area, avoid skin and eye contact, and follow all Safety Data Sheet (SDS) guidelines. Keep away from open flames and sparks.

### Can I adjust the viscosity?

ABChimie&reg; 6025 UV LED can be customized for variable viscosities. Contact our team for guidance.

## Learn More About ABChimie&reg; 6025 UV LED

ABChimie&reg; 6025 UV LED is a proven solution for engineers seeking fast, reliable protection of electronic assemblies in demanding manufacturing environments. This UV-curable resin delivers rapid curing, excellent electrical insulation, and strong environmental resistance&mdash;ideal for applications in automotive electronics, industrial automation, consumer electronics, and other high-reliability assemblies.

## Main Advantages of ABChimie 6025 UV LED

UV Curing

ABChimie&reg; 6025 UV LED cures rapidly under UV light, enabling integration into both batch and inline production. The resin forms a durable, high-performance layer that protects assemblies while supporting high-throughput manufacturing.

MECHANICAL PROTECTION

ABChimie&reg; 6025 UV LED cures to a Shore hardness of A60 , providing excellent mechanical protection. This hardness helps resist scratches, abrasion, and minor impacts, ensuring long-term stability of encapsulated components.

THIXOTROPIC

ABChimie&reg; 6025 UV LED is thixotropic: it maintains a stable, non-running consistency at rest but flows easily under shear during application. This ensures precise placement, minimal sagging, and uniform coverage before rapid UV curing.

EXCELLENT ADHESION ON FLEXIBLE SUBSTRATES

ABChimie&reg; 6025 UV LED bonds strongly to flexible substrates, including plastics and polymer-based PCBs. Its adhesion ensures reliable protection even on surfaces that bend or flex, ideal for wearables, flexible electronics, and lightweight assemblies.

### How to Choose a Resin

Selecting the most suitable resin requires consideration of key factors:

- ✔ Norms & Compliance

- ✔ Environment / Exposure Conditions
