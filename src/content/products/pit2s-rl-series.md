shortDescription: LINQTAPE™ PIT2S-RL-Series s is a high-temperature resistant polyimide tape on a 2 mil PET release liner. It is designed primarily for high temperature temporary bonding applications and it removes cleanly without adhesive residue after exposure to heat or chemicals. It may also be used in electrical insulation applications that require Class H tape grade. LINQTAPE™ PIT2S-RL-Series provides an excellent balance of electrical, mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties over a wide range of temperatures. It has enhanced strength for puncture and tear resistance and can be used in applications that may see intermittent temperatures up to 260°C (500°F). LINQTAPE™ PIT2S-RL-Series comes as a standard in 36 yard (33m) lengths of varying widths, but longer rolls may be available upon request.
