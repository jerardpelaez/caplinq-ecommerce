Recommended UV Cure Condition UV lamp 80Watt/cm or UV lamp 120Watt/cm When applying LOCTITE EDAG PF 455BC E&C as a crossover, two layers of approximately 12 to 15μm each should be applied. Cure both layers at an energy level of 0.5Joule/cm2 to obtain a good inter- coat adhesion between the first and second layer and to obtain a maximum adhesion of the crossover. When using LOCTITE EDAG PF 455BC E&C as a crossover, be sure to dry the inks printed over it within 5 minutes. Do not let the inks printed over LOCTITE EDAG PF 455BC E&C air dry for extended periods of time.
