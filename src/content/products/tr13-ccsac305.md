shortDescription: LINQALLOY CC- SAC305 are copper core SAC305 solder spheres in a Tape and Reel format of 13 inches. Our CC-SAC305 solder sphere product range encompasses solder spheres of varying diameters, spanning from 300 to 889 microns. In the production of integrated circuits (ICs), the usage of solder spheres is critical for achieving precise amounts and placement of solder material. Automated production processes facilitate high-volume manufacturing of ICs, with the different components of the ICs being placed using pick and place machines. Packaging techniques such as ball grid arrays (PBGA, CBGA, TBGA, and µBGA) and flip chips (C4) use solder spheres in their production. To enable the utilization of our solder spheres in these high-volume, automated processes, we offer our solder spheres in a Tape and Reel format. Our Tape and Reel solder spheres are compatible with nearly all existing pick and place tape feeders, enabling seamless integration with your current pick and place equipment. Our Tape and Reel packaging service is available for all sizes of solder spheres. If the solder sphere size you require is not listed in our product range, kindly contact us for a quote.
