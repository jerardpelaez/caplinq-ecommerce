shortDescription: OPTOLINQ LE-2161 is a transparent, two-part epoxy resin ideal for potting small components and sealing large dot matrix panels. It offers a fast curing rate, moderate curing temperature, and low viscosity post-mixing, and delivers exceptional electrical properties and transparency upon curing. To meet specific color requirements, it can easily be colored and diffused using specialized dye concentrates and diffusant concentrates. OPTOLINQ LE-2161 serves as an ideal option for various electronic applications, including smart rings, due to its ability to encapsulate delicate electronic components while maintaining transparency and providing robust electrical insulation.

### Anti-yellowing Performance of LE-2161


The following optical images of cured Optolinq LE-2161 samples (10 and 30 g) demonstrate its anti-yellowing capability under two distinct conditions: exposure to 70 °C for 18 hours and to 85 °C, 85% RH for 24 hours. The observed cloudiness is due to the presence of an anti-yellowing filler, a critical component for smart ring technology. This filler serves a crucial purpose without compromising the transmittance of the encapsulant, although it's important to note that the material's thickness can influence this aspect.






### Recommended Curing Conditions


Cure at 25 °C for 24 h or at 50–60° C for 4 h. These guidelines offer recommended curing parameters. Define the exact curing parameters to align with your product specifications.


### Precautions for Use



- The usable time after A and B are mixed strongly depends on the temperature and mixing volume. Higher temperatures and larger mixing volumes lead to shorter working times. Therefore, the mixing temperature and amount should be determined based on on-site procedures.

- Use the product in a clean and well-ventilated workplace.

- Wear appropriate safety equipment before use and avoid direct contact with the body. Please read the Material Safety Data Sheet (SDS) carefully before using.




Please note that the provided information is based on available data and typical conditions. For specific applications and detailed test results, refer to the actual test data and conduct appropriate certifications.


### Storage and Handling


Store in a ventilated, dry, and clean environment. Keep away from fire and heat sources. It is strictly forbidden to store in outdoor environments. The validity time will vary depending on storage conditions. At proper storage conditions, Part A and Part B have a shelf life of 183 and 93 days, respectively. Shelf life can be extended by using cold storage.
