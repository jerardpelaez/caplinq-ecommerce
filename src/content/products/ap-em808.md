### Reflow Profile

The recommended reflow profile for EM808 made with SAC alloys is shown here. This profile is simply a guideline. Since EM808 is a highly active solder paste, it can solder effectively over a wide range of profiles. Your optimal profile may be different from the one shown based on your oven, board and mix of defects. Please contact MacDermid Alpha Technical Support if you need additional profiling advice.
