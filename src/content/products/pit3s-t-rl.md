shortDescription: "LINQTAPE&trade; PIT3S-T-RL tapes are high performance, temperature resistant polyimide tapes that use a polyimide film as a backing film. This flame retardant backing film is the generic version of DuPont's Kapton HN film and has a thickness of 3mil (76.2&micro;m). Laminatedon it is a 1mil (25.4&micro;m) thick pressure sensitive silicone adhesive making the total thickness of the polyimide film plus adhesive only 4mil (101.6&micro;m) thick. PIT3S-T-RL remains both electrically and mechanically stable across temperatures ranging from -269&deg;C to 400&deg;C (-452&deg;F to 752&deg;F). Polyimide tape is widely used in applications requiring high electrical insulation and an excellent balance of thermal, mechanical, chemical and electrical properties. As a base material, polyimide is extremely versatile as it can be die-cut, punched and thermoformed with or without adhesive. It is extremely well suited, and extensively used for wrapping cable and magnet wire. A further list of applications includes, but is not limited to aircraft and spacecraft wiring, insulation tubing, slot insulation, fiber optics cable, heater circuits, automotive diaphragms and manifolds, high temperature splicing and other applications that can make use of the ultra-thin, high temperature, electrically insulating properties of the PIT3S-T-RL polyimide HN tapes. Applications Cable Wrapping Magnet Wire Wrapping Automotive Manifolds Automotive Diaphragms Flexible Printed Circuits Heater Circuits Aircraft / Spacecraft Wiring Insulation Tubing Slot Insulation Fiber Optics Cable High Temperature Splicing 3D printing ABS plastic Product Features and Benefits Good Chemical Resistance Mechanically and electrically stable from -269&deg;C to 400&deg;C (-452&deg;F to 752&deg;F) Can be laminated, die-cut, metallized, punched, adhesive coated and thermoformed Insensitive to radiation damage Adheres well to ABS Improved Moisure Barrier Product Nomenclature PIT: HN Polyimide Tape 3: 3 mil (76.2&micro;m) thick tape S: Silicone adhesive T: 1 mil, Thin Adhesive Layer RL: Release liner"
