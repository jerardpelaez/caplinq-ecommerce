- Industrial automation (e.g., motor drives, PLCs)

- Consumer electronics (e.g., smart devices, wearables)

- Other high-reliability electronic assemblies

### Why choose ABChimie&reg; 836 UV?

ABChimie&reg; 836 UV delivers rapid UV curing, excellent electrical insulation, optical transparency, and strong adhesion to flexible substrates. It supports high-throughput manufacturing while providing durable protection for sensitive components.

### What is the shelf life of ABChimie&reg; 836 UV?

ABChimie&reg; 836 UV has a shelf life of 12 months when stored at 5&ndash;30&deg;C in tightly sealed containers. Prior to use, allow the product to equilibrate for 24 hours at 18&ndash;32&deg;C for optimal performance.

### What happens after the shelf life?

Using ABChimie&reg; 836 past its shelf life may alter viscosity, affecting uniformity and application performance. Always use an in-date product for reliable results.

### What is the recommended curing method for ABChimie&reg; 836 UV?

ABChimie&reg; 836 UV is UV-curable and should be cured with a mercury lamp. The minimum UVA dose is 1000 mJ/cm&sup2; for a 100 &mu;m thickness. The mercury lamp-curable version is ABChimie&reg; 836 UV. Higher UVA doses do not negatively affect final properties.

### What is the recommended thickness for ABChimie&reg; 836 UV?

ABChimie&reg; 836 UV coating thickness depends on the application method. Recommended thickness 30 &ndash; 130 microns Spraying 30-90 microns Selective coating machine (film coater) 90-130 microns (380mm/s)

### Should I control the application environment?

ABChimie&reg; 836 UV should be applied at a minimum temperature of 16&deg;C and a minimum relative humidity of 50% are recommended for coating application. The relative humidity of at least 50% is recommended for the second ABchimie TDS ABchimie836UV and UV LED polymerization mechanism. Before applying, the printed circuit board must be clean, dry, and free of moisture. A stage in an oven at 80 &deg;C for 4 hours is usually sufficient.

### Can I adjust the viscosity?

ABChimie&reg; 836 UV can be customized for variable viscosities. Contact our team for guidance.

Application tips

## How to Optimise for the Best Results

 

pcb preparation

PCBs must be completely dry and thoroughly clean, with no dust, grease, wax, or other contaminants. Coating adhesion depends directly on the quality of the substrate. All flux residues must be fully removed, as they can become corrosive and lead to circuit malfunctions.

How to clean the pcb

For cleaning equipment or removing uncured ABchimie836UV or UV LED varnish, we recommend using SND or ABclean solvent.

uv recommendation

It is essential to use the correct UV equipment (UV or LED) and follow the recommended settings to achieve the optimal properties of the cured conformal coating. These parameters influence both the coating&rsquo;s reactivity and surface quality. ABchimie836UV and UV LED cure through UV exposure, with moisture contributing to a secondary curing mechanism.

Curing Mechanism: UV light creates the first cure, and after 7 days the moisture from the environment completes the curing process.

double-curing mechanism

### How does Moisture Cure Work?

During UV curing, exposure to UV light activates the photoinitiators in the conformal coating, triggering rapid polymerization of the resin. This results in an immediate surface cure and fast development of handling strength. UV curing provides precise, on-demand curing in exposed areas, enabling high-throughput processing while maintaining coating uniformity. ABchimie836UV and ABchimie836UV LED use the same dual curing mechanism to ensure complete curing, including in shadowed or hard-to-reach areas. Initial curing is achieved by UV exposure, while a secondary moisture-activated cure completes the process at ambient temperature. For full curing in shaded areas, a minimum relative humidity of 50% is required for at least 7 days. Alternative to Mercury Lamp Curing of ABChimie 836 UV

ABChimie 836 UV is also available in the LED lamp version, which cures with an LED lamp.
