shortDescription: Hysol GR180T is a white, transmitting epoxy molding compound used for optical applications. This crystal silica filled (70%) product has been specifically designed to improve light transmittance and workability for optocouplers also knows as photo-couplers, optical isolators, or opto-isolators. Hysol GR180T cures with heat and has been developed to be workable for transfer molding processes. It has been formulated to provide the best possible moldability for a wide range of molding process parameters.
