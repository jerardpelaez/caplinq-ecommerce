shortDescription: Aculon's Multi-Surface Oleophobic technology is designed to make many surfaces substrate hydrophobic, oleophobic, and repellent to nearly any liquid. Aculon's Multi-Surface Oleophobic treatment is quick and easy to apply, optically clear, and ultra-thin. For the application no capital investment is required, thus the treatment can be applied via several methods, including dip (30 nm), wipe (200-300 nm), or spray. Advantages of Aculon's Multi-Surface Oleophobic Treatment Repels most liquids Optically clear (100% transmission) No capital equipment Easily reapplied in the field if damaged

### How to apply Aculon's Multi Surface Hydrophobic Treatment






STEP 1 ⇨ CLEAN




STEP 2 ⇨ TREAT




STEP 3 ⇨ DRY








For this technology, cleaning is not typically required but is recommended. To clean, remove any visual dust, dirt, and grime that could damage the surface.




Dip - Fully immerse the part in the treatment solution for 1 minute. Withdraw the part at a steady rate to ensure even coverage. Allow to dry or cure, then wipe clean with a microfiber cloth.






Air dry at room temperature until the surface is dry to the touch.


In some cases, additional thermal curing (e.g. 100°C for 5 minutes) may boost performance.










Wipe - Using a clean cotton cloth, wet it with the solution then rub the substrate for 10 seconds, air dry, then wipe clean with a microfiber cloth.






Spray - Spray the solution on the substrate, air dry. If the coating is too thick, reduce the amount applied by changing the settings on the spray gun or using a diluent.










### Application Tips



- In some cases, additional thermal curing ( e.g. 100°C for 5 minutes) may boost performance.

- Inkjet printing or roll coating can also be used to apply the treatment.

- Spray Equipment Suggestions: HVLP(Binks Mach 1), HVLP(Devilbiss JGHV), Air Atomization(Devilbiss MBC gun), and Airless(Graco Model 225-292 President Pump Series A).
