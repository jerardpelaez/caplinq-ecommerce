shortDescription: LINQCELL GDL2200 is a graphitized carbon plate that boasts a through-plane resistance of less than 17 mΩcm2. With a thickness of 2.2mm ±0.2mm (@50 kpa), it delivers optimal performance in fuel cells and electrolyzers as an electrode, gas diffusion layer, or porous transport layer. One of the unique features of LINQCELL GDL2200 is its density of ±0.6-0.75 g/cm3 and through-plane resistivity of 110mΩ-cm, which results in a voltage loss of only 35mV. This ensures reliable and efficient performance in high-performance fuel cells and electrolyzers. In addition, its high compressibility and porosity make it an excellent choice for optimal reactant transport to the catalyst layer, ensuring the best possible performance in various fuel cell applications. Its low electrical resistance, high thermal conductivity, and durability also make it ideal for use as a Porous Transport Layer (PTL) in PEM electrolyzers, PEMFCs, and PAFCs. LINQCELL GDL2200 is a high-performance carbon paper that offers unique features and specifications suitable for fuel cells and electrolyzers. Its low electrical resistance, high thermal conductivity, compressibility, and porosity make it an ideal choice for various fuel cell and electrolyzer applications.

The material shows no linear stress-strain relationship, confirming it does not follow Hooke’s Law. This is expected due to its anisotropic and non-homogeneous structure. Despite this, it exhibited elastic behavior, fully recovering after unloading with no plastic deformation observed.
