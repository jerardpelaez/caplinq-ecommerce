## Product Description

LinQFill UF-100 is a fast-flow capillary underfill material designed to enhance the reliability of flip chip, ball grid array (BGA), and chip-scale package (CSP) solder interconnections. When dispensed along the perimeter of a mounted die or package, the UF-100 wicks rapidly into the gap between the component and substrate by capillary action, encapsulating the solder bumps and creating a stress-distributing layer that dramatically improves resistance to thermal cycling, mechanical shock, and drop impact.

Formulated with 68 wt% nano-silica filler in a fast-curing epoxy matrix, the UF-100 achieves a low coefficient of thermal expansion (28 ppm/°C below Tg) that closely matches the CTE of solder and silicon, minimizing the strain concentration at solder joints during temperature excursions. Its flow rate exceeds 30 mm/min in a 100 µm gap at 110 °C, enabling complete underfill of large-area flip chip devices within seconds. A rapid gel time of 45 seconds at 165 °C supports high-volume production throughput.

The cured UF-100 exhibits a Tg of 155 °C and a die shear strength exceeding 30 MPa at 260 °C, providing the mechanical strength needed to withstand lead-free reflow temperatures. It is compatible with a wide range of solder alloys (SAC305, SnPb, SnBi) and substrate materials (organic, ceramic, silicon). The UF-100 is supplied in frozen syringes and has a shelf life of 6 months at -40 °C.

## Key Features

- Fast capillary flow rate (>30 mm/min) for high-throughput production
- Low CTE (28 ppm/°C) closely matched to solder and silicon
- High Tg (155 °C) for lead-free reflow compatibility
- Rapid gel time (45 s at 165 °C) for quick cycle times
- Excellent adhesion to organic and ceramic substrates
- No filler settling during storage or processing
- Compatible with SAC305, SnPb, and SnBi solder alloys

## Applications

LinQFill UF-100 is used in high-volume semiconductor assembly for underfilling flip chip packages on organic and ceramic substrates, reinforcing BGA solder joints in mobile devices and servers, and strengthening CSP interconnections in smartphones and wearable electronics. It is particularly effective in applications subjected to repeated thermal cycling (e.g., automotive ECUs) or mechanical shock and drop impact (e.g., mobile phones and tablets). The UF-100 is also used for rework underfill of BGA components in field repair and depot-level maintenance of high-value electronic assemblies.
