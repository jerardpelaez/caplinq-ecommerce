shortDescription: "LINQSOL EMC-7535MF is a green epoxy molding compound specifically developed for high-voltage and high-power semiconductor devices. It offers low modulus to meet low-stress requirements. With a high glass transition temperature (Tg = 215 °C), minimal moisture absorption, a high comparative tracking index (CTI = 600 V), and a UL 94 V-0 flammability rating highlighting its adherence to stringent safety standards for high-power semiconductor applications, EMC-7535MF guarantees strong performance and outstanding reliability. Overall, LINQSOL EMC-7535MF seamlessly integrates advanced material properties, safety compliance, and superior performance, precisely meeting the stringent demands of high-power semiconductor components such as TO packages. LINQSOL EMC-7535MF finds its niche in high-voltage and high-power discrete packages and power modules, including but not limited to IGBT, TO220, TO247, and other surface mount devices. LINQSOL EMC-7535MF proved its reliability in customers' small SiC discretes—zero voids, zero delamination on Ni-plated Cu leadframes—even after thermal cycles (−40 °C ↔ +125 °C). Key Features: High-temperature stability with high Tg (215 °C) Excellent electrical stability due to low ion content and mobility Low stress with low CTE (9 ppm) and low modulus (15GPa) Low moisture absorption and low mold shrinkage (0.22%) Halogen-free (does not contain Br, Sb, P) UL 94 V-0 Flammability Application: SiC MOSFETs; TO-package Devices, IGBT Modules"
