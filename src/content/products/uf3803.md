Instructions for Use:



- Before use, thaw the product at room temperature for 2–3 hours. Ensure the syringe is placed vertically during thawing. Keep the container airtight until it reaches room temperature.



Ensure the surface to be bonded is clean and free of contaminants.




Cure time may vary based on the actual part geometry, material volume, and equipment. It is recommended that the test be done on actual parts and equipment.




For large-scale applications, consider a staged curing process: start with a lower temperature pre-cure, followed by a full cure at a higher temperature to effectively manage heat release.




Cool down gradually after curing to minimize thermal stress.




The epoxy cannot be refrozen once exposed to room temperature.
