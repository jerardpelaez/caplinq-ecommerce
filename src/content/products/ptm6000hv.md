shortDescription: PTM6000HV, commonly known as PTM6000HV, is a highly thermally conductive Phase Change Material (PCM) in paste format. This High viscosity(HV) version of PTM6000-SP is designed to minimize thermal resistance at interfaces and maintain extremely stable performance through reliability testing required for long product life applications. It has a very wide process window that makes it an optimal, tailor made option for IGBT printing and honeycomb structures. PTM6000HV is based on a robust polymer PCM structure and exhibits excellent wetting properties during typical operating temperature ranges, resulting in very low surface contact resistance. This material exhibits excellent wetting at interfaces during typical operating temperature range, resulting in very low surface contact resistance. PTM6000HV is a proprietary material that uses a proprietary filler to provide superior reliability (pass 150˚C baking 2000 hours, temperature cycling 2000 cycles, and HAST 288 hours) and maintains low thermal impedance (has been renamed from PTM6000HV-SP for the sake of simplicity. It is the exact same product. Reference the PTM6000 Automotive Reliability Report which demonstrates its performance and thermal stability after various long-term reliability tests including HAST 192hrs, T/C-B 4000x and High Temperature Baking of 3000hrs.

When choosing a printable paste it is important to understand the process parameters and limitations.


That's why we ask, when you contact us, to include the following information:



- What is your print thickness?

- How long is your printing time and working window?

What is your drying step after printing?


- Temperature (Room temperature or something else?)

- Time




- Do you have any viscosity limitations in the printing process?




 
**Product Use**
Clamping pressure and temperature are suggested to achieve a minimum bond line thickness of the thermal interface material, typically less than 1.5 mil (0.038mm) for best performance.
The material must go through the phase change temperature to exhibit entitlement performance.

**Formulated specifically for IGBT modules assembly**
 
The material is Optimized for IGBT printing and honeycomb structures with wider process time of >30 minutes. This material's high viscosity helps with printing and application in honeycomb structures, while its wide process window allows for easier and more reliable assembly of power modules in applications like inverters.
 


 
 
PTM6000HV is available as 650g (280cc Al cartridge) or 1000g (1 kg can). We also have 2 kg cans and 5 gallon pails if larger configurations are desired. All other printable pastes are available in these two same configurations since the densities of printable PCM paste fall in the range of 2.0 – 2.7 g/cc.

280cc cartridges are intentionally about 90% filled (650g) to allow for room at the top to fit the adaptor/plunger for dispensing.

Other lower filled configurations in 280cc cartridges are possible, if there is sufficient volume or justified with manufacturability concerns.
