sellingPoints:
  - 0.30 mm wire diameter
  - Excellent chemical stability and anti-corrosion resistance
  - High electrical conductivity
shortDescription: "LINQCELL NWM300 is a finely woven wire mesh made from high-purity nickel alloy, with a wire diameter of 0.30 mm and a nickel content of at least 99.9%. Its mesh size and uniformity complies with GB/T 17492. This mesh offers excellent electrical conductivity, chemical stability, corrosion resistance, and mechanical durability. Its versatile properties make NWM300 suitable for different electrochemical devices, including water electrolyzers, fuel cells, and batteries, such as nickel–metal hydride (NiMH) and nickel–cadmium (NiCd) batteries. Key Features: High corrosion resistance Very low impurities Cheaper and more cost efficient than sintered titanium In water electrolyzers and fuel cells, LINQCELL NWM300 can be used both as a gas diffusion layer, facilitating mass and electron transfer within the device, and gas diffusion electrode when catalyst layers are directly applied onto it. Its suitability for alkaline systems has established it as a standard electrode material in alkaline water electrolyzers. Highly Recommended for: Porous transport layer for water electrolyzers Fuel cell gas diffusion layer Electrodes for alkaline water electrolyzers LINQCELL NWM300 comes in different mesh counts (30, 40, 46, and 60), allowing precise tuning of diffusivity to meet various device design requirements. It is also available in two Ni grades: N4 (Ni201), and N6 (Ni200)."
