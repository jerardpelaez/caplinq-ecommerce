shortDescription: "Hysol MG33F-0659 is a black, semiconductor-grade epoxy molding compound (duroplast) designed for the encapsulation and protection of tantalum capacitors and surface mount resistors. Because of its fast cure, it is also very well suited for the manufacture of reed relays. Hysol MG33F-0659 has a filler weight of 75% and is formulated with a short gel time to make it useful for the production of (Ta) Tantalum capacitors through automolding processes. It is an environmentally friendly \"green\" molding compound which contains no bromine, antimony or phosphorus flame retardant and meets UL 94 V-0 Flammability at 6.35mm thickness. Typical applications: Tantalum capacitors Reed relays Aluminum housed resistors (Check why MG33F-0659 is suitable for this application) Features: Fast cured formulation (Check the curing conditions) Long spiral flow to provide best moldability and wide molding latitude Great adhesion to copper substrates and CTE matched with Al High thermal stability (High Tg and low stress ) Low mold shrinkage (0.16%) for large components molding"

## MG33F-0659 Epoxy Mold Compound for Aluminum Housed Resistors





Hysol MG33F-0659 is formulated based on MG33-0690, which is a industrial proven product for aluminum housed resistors encapsulation. They have pretty similar properties. You could check the properties comparison table below. Two extra advantages of MG33F-0659 are:



- (1) MG33F-0659 contains green flame retardants and meet UL90 V-0 flammability @1/4 inches, which MG33-0690 does not have.

- (2) MG33F-0659 has lower mold shrinkage than MG33-0690.




In conclusion, Hysol MG33F-0659 is a good alternative to MG33-0690 for aluminum housed resistor application.
