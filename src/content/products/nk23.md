shortDescription: "LINQFILM NK 23 is a two-ply laminate film consisting of 3 mils of Polyimide (Kapton) laminated with 2 mils of Aramid (Nomex) paper from one side, resulting in a film with a total of 5 mil thickness. Nomex paper is bonded to the Polyimide film at high temperature and results in a laminate with good dielectric properties, high heat resistance and high mechanical strength. NK means Nomex - Kapton. Both Nomex and Kapton are registered trademark names of Aramid paper and Polyimide film respectively. While the trademarks have expired a long time ago, the abbreviation for this kind of laminate remained NKN (NK in this case). Nomex Kapton (Aramid Polyimide) films are great Class H insulators for slot, phase, turn to turn, liner and barrier applications in rotating motors. They can be used as transformer and inductor windings while being a popular choice for a wide range of electrical applications. Key Features: Good dielectric properties High heat resistance High mechanical strength Wide range of applications"
