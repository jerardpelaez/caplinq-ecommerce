shortDescription: Hysol GR15F-MOD2C is a black, epoxy-based molding compound designed for high voltage, high temperature semiconductor applications. It has a very high Glass Transition Temperature (Tg) of 236°C and is in use in 2nd generation silicon carbide (SiC) MOSFET of world’s leading manufacturer of Silicon Carbide based diodes for power control and management. This C product is a longer spiral flow version of the MOD2. Hysol GR15F-MOD2C is the world's first high Tg, "Green" Anhydride. Anhydride-based epoxy has traditionally had a low Tg and contained halogens, making it not environmentally "Green". On the other hand, anhydride chemistries have very good HTRB test results because there is very little ion movement at higher temperatures, the traditional cause of HTRB failures. Hysol's new MG15F-MOD2C is a breakthrough product that offers an incredibly high Tg, and is an environmentally "green" product without any halogens (Bromine, Chlorine) or antimony (Sb). Hysol GR15F-MOD2C is well suited for SiC devices. Older generation silicon Si MOSFETS operated at (only) 600V. New Silicon Carbide devices operate at 1200V. These new 1200V MOSFETS deliver power density and switching efficiency at half the cost per amp of our previous generation MOSFETs. CREE claims that with this new MOSFET platform, that they already have design wins in multiple segments like solar inverters and uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems. They continue to say that due to rapid acceptance of this 2nd generation of SiC MOSFETs, CREE is shipping pre-production volumes ahead of schedule and ramping volume production in-line with customer demand. Hysol GR15F-MOD2C has excellent high temperature reliability bias (HTRB) test results. MG15F-MOD2C Outperforms competition on HSOP “plastic RF module” by passing 1500 cycles -65/+200ºC. Furthermore, it is qualified on TO220 & TO247 packages with large silicon carbide die running up to 1200V at an operation temperature.To add to that, Hysol has more than 12 years experience molding HF RF amplifiers guaranteed for 200°C for continuous operation.

### Where do we go from here?




### Do you have any molding compounds that can be used for Space applications and withstand temperatures above 200°C?


There is not much research going on regarding EMC specifically suitable for space applications.


Due to the restriction of the EMC chemistry system itself, they all start to show some extent of properties degradation from 200 ℃. Hysol has done research on innovative resin/hardener types and modifications, but the results are still confidential and could not be shared yet. For example, there is research in china and japan regarding the benzoxazine resin types in the academic institute, but again, not been commercialized yet. Here is a review paper for your reference. There are some other types of encapsulants such as silicone-based ones that could resist higher temperatures, but they are not suitable for the molding process but for potting.

The automotive standard is already one of the highest standards in the industry for the encapsulation of consumer electronics. Thus, most of Hysol's product test data on customer application sites are based on that. Those applications do not require consistent above 200-degree operating temperatures so you may need to do some high-temperature storage tests on your own devices to see how it works.
 
 

### How do you measure temperature stability in EMCs? Is there an industry standard?

 
There is no specific industry standard for the EMC manufacturing industry like JEDEC. There are still some tests we could do to indicate the temperature stability of an EMC product. Every supplier develops their own methodology based on their understanding of this topic. 
The ideal is to test the stability of each property for long hours on your operating temperatures. As you can see, there are several groups of properties to describe an EMC product. The degradation of hygro-thermomechanical, electrical, and chemical properties is what we look into while doing the high-temperature storage tests.
 


For hygro-thermomechanical and chemical properties measurements, general test methods for polymers are used, like those ASTM ones. But those tests are carried out under different temperature conditions. You will generate some figures as below:
 


For electrical properties, Hysol uses Dielectric Thermal Analysis (DETA). I will send an introduction slide to you later. Using this method, you could indicate the electrical property stability of an EMC under various high power conditions. Typical data figures are like:

Anhydride epoxies tend to stick quite a lot to the mold. It is common to use up to 10 shots of melamine to clean the molding compound residues. Visit our Cleaning and Conditioning category to find the ideal cleaning solution for your process.
