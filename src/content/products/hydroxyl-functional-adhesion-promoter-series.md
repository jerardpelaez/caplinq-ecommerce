shortDescription: Aculon, a proven supplier of industrial-grade coatings, introduces their patented Hydroxyl Functional Adhesion Promoter. Aculon's Hydroxyl Functional Adhesion Promoter is a nano-scale surface treatment coating that promotes adhesion across a broad spectrum of metal surfaces. It is quick and easy to apply and will eliminate adhesive failures. The adhesion primer can be applied via most traditional coating processes, including dipping, spraying, wiping, etc., and provides an optically clear, uniform coating thickness of 2-4 nm. Also, their actives can be blended into existing formulations for increased surface adhesion of coatings and adhesives. The Hydroxyl Functional Adhesion Promoter is designed to improve adhesion for coatings that cross-link with hydroxyl functional groups, for example, urethane, melamine-formaldehyde, and phenolic-epoxy based coatings. Advantages of Aculon's Hydroxyl Functional Adhesion Promoter Improved adhesion strength of paints/coatings on metal surfaces Uniform Thicknesses at the Nanoscale 100% transmission for Visible Light Minimal Capital Equipment Requirements Does not leach

### How to apply the Hydroxyl Functional Adhesion Promoter






STEP 1 ⇨ CLEAN




STEP 2 ⇨ TREAT




STEP 3 ⇨ DRY








Parts must be sufficiently clean before treatment for proper bonding and effective application.


To clean, solvents or soap and water can be used to degrease the substrate.






Spray - Spray the solution onto the substrate using double passes.




If curing is necessary (short dip times are used), the treated substrates are best cured at 120⁰C peak metal temperature for approximately 30 seconds.


For silicon and titanium oxides, lengthening the cure time to 5 minutes is recommended.








Dip - Fully immerse the part in the treatment solution for 5 minutes. To decrease the dip time, post-cure is recommended for optimal performance.






Dip with Sonification - Completely submerge the substrate in the solution and sonicate for five minutes. Then remove the substrate and allow it to air dry.








### How do you use Hydroxyl Functional Adhesion Promoter | OP272 as an additive?


There isn’t a real recipe, as it depends on so many factors. Our recommendation would be to work in the 0.1-0.5% wt add range if it’s soluble. You can pre-dissolve in a solvent then add that to the base resin and heat to evaporate any residual solvent. Also, spraying it at different loading levels onto the surface can work in the same way, creating an interface layer that’s concentrated with the adhesion promoter.


### Application Tips



- For spray application, post-application curing is recommended for best performance.

- Coat the substrate as soon as possible after cleaning to prevent recontamination.

- Spray Equipment Suggestions: HVLP(Binks Mach 1), HVLP(Devilbiss JGHV), Air Atomization(Devilbiss MBC gun), and Airless(Graco Model 225-292 President Pump Series A).

- Cure temperatures and conditions should be optimized based on substrate and durability requirements.

- Clean all equipment with alcohol (e.g., Isopropanol) or the solvent used.

- If a UV-curable coating system is being used, then it may be necessary to modify the curing parameters to ensure sufficient radical generation near the surface of the monolayer to achieve optimal adhesion.






### Application Ideas



- Use to improve lead-frame adhesion in many electronics applications

- Improved bonding of an epoxy over-mold compound (best for molding compounds that require a thermal cure above 60-70 ⁰C)

- Prevent delamination of finished products

- Increase polyurethane-to-metal adhesion

- For coatings that cross-link with acrylic functional groups, Methacrylate Functional Adhesion Promoter is a better fit.
