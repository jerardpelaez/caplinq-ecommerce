shortDescription: This product has limited availability for niche applications. It is listed as No longer available but please reach out to us if there is demand for high quantities that cannot be achieved by Film factors. LOCTITE® ABLESTIK ACP 3122 is an anisotropic epoxy adhesive designed for high throughput microelectronics assembly applications. This adhesive conducts in only one direction, making it suitable for small die and component attachment without the possibility of electrical shorting. ACP-3122 requires pressure during cure to establish a reliable interconnect. Even though it is listed as an Underfill, LOCTITE® ABLESTIK ACP 3122 can also be used to bond a die, facilitate electrical connections under the bumps and (finally, as an underfill) destress the area around the bumps. So it goes without saying that it is a multi purpose product. Anisotropic pastes & films work well over a limited operating temperature range. If you are looking to operate outside of the range of -40°C/+125°C (or maybe even -40°C/+ 90°C) then there could be some issues with reliability that need to be tested. Cure Schedule 5 seconds @ 150°C under optimum pressure, bondline temperature LOCTITE ABLESTIK ACP 3122 requires pressure during cure to establish a reliable connection. Most dies up to 1 sq mm in size require a 1 to 3 Newtons to form a reliable interconnect. The optimum pressure is best determined for each new design. The recommended bonding condition for this adhesive is 5 seconds at a bondline temperature of 150ºC. No post cure is required. Material properties will depend upon cure conditions used
