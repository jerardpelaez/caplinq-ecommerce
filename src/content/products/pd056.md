shortDescription: LOCTITE EDAG PD 056 E&C PVC vinyl coating consists of silver particles in a thermoplastic resin that rapidly air dries to form a flexible conductive coating. It is fully miscible with LOCTITE SS 24600 E&C conductive graphite coating to provide a range of resistances. LOCTITE EDAG PD 056 E&C is one of a series of LOCTITE EDAG coatings designed to provide controlled electrical properties. It can be used on ITO sputtered polyester films, Copper circuitry, Glass and metal substrates and has a maximum operating temperature of 104°C. This material has a very wide range of applications typically used for electronic circuits, as a flexible conductive coating for plastic substrates, on rotogravure printed circuits, smart labels/RFID, medical sensors and EMI shielding. Cure Schedule Infrared or Hot air drying
