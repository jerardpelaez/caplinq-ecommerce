shortDescription: LOCTITE ABLESTIK EMI 8890SB is an electrically conductive adhesive designed to achieve robust electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding performance with extremely thin coating thickness at a single micrometer level for package level shielding applications. LOCTITE ABLESTIK EMI 8890SB has robust adhesion to mold compound, epoxy, copper, gold and silver surfaces. When spray-coated, this material can be atomized to highly fine droplets for excellent uniformity at low to high coating thicknesses which can be controlled by equipment parameters.
