shortDescription: "Hysol GR60 Series is a black semiconductor-grade epoxy molding compound designed for the encapsulation and protection of intelligent powder module (IPM) applications. With excellent workability and reliability, GR60 series is suitable for long wire or large body devices. With high thermal conductivity (1.7 ~ 2.2 W/mk), GR60 could be applied in SiC IGBT module with Tj 175°C and 1200V. More thermal conductive versions are also under development. Hysol GR60 is an environmentally \"green\" product, meaning that it doesn't contain any halogens including bromine, antimony or phosphorus flame retardants. Hysol GR60 meets UL 94 V-0 Flammability at 1/8 inch thickness. Key features are summarized as: Reliability (check GR60 HT beta-site tests) High adhesion to Cu/Ag/Ni Low stress and low water absorption High thermal conductivity Excellent performance in HAST, HTRB, TC, PCT, HTS, etc. Moldability Excellent workability with wide process window No wire sweep Good warpage control Available versions: GR60 HT, GR60 PT (check the GR60 comparison) Suitable Package: Full pack type IPM, substrate type IPM"

## Epoxy Molding Compound For IPM Application


Hysol has developed different series (GR60 series, GR600 series, GR750 series, etc.) for IPM application. Highly conductive versions are also in development.


Beside the common features, the two version GR60 PT and GR60 HT have their own unique features to meet niche requirements for your module. The differences between GR60 PT and GR60 HT:



- Thermal conductivity: 1.7 W/mK (GR60 PT) v.s. 2.2 W/mK (GR60 HT)

- Good adhesion to: Cu & Au surface (GR60 PT) v.s. Cu & Au & Ni surface (GR60 HT)

- Others: high cost-efficient (GR60 PT) and good moisture resistance (GR60 HT)






 
  **GR60 Series For IPM Application**

Hysol GR60 series products are highly thermal conductive molding compounds designed for IPM applications. Both GR60 HT and GR60 PT are dedicated to module package with excellent workability and reliability, suitable for long wire or large body device. The key common features of GR60HT and GR60PT are:


Workability



- No wire sweep

- Warpage control

- Wide molding window




Great peformance



- Good electrical stability during tests

- High thermal conductivity

- Flammability rating UL94 V-0 @1/8 inch
