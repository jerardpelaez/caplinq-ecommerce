shortDescription: Hysol GR300 is a black semiconductor-grade epoxy molding compound designed for the encapsulation and protection of TO220 and TO247 power devices. Once molded and post-mold cured, this product provides optimum protection and reliability for these semiconductor devices. It exhibits good HTRB results and strikes an excellent balance of performance and moldability. While it is a great product, new developments have been made since its formulation so you might want also want to take a look at the new and improved Hysol GR30 that has better moldability and electrical properties. Hysol GR300 is an environmentally "green" product, meaning that doesn't contain any bromine, antimony or phosphorus flame retardants. Previous MG-series EMC dominated the space for power semiconductors but used halogen-containing flame retardants. This next generation epoxy mold compound replaces these older generation products. This material is designed to achieve JEDEC Level 1 requirements at 260°C reflow temperature on Nickel or Nickel-plated leadframes. Hysol GR300 meets UL 94 V-0 Flammability at 1/8 inch (3.18mm) thickness.

Designed for TO220 & TO247 devices


TO220 and TO247 are big, bulky packages, so molding these products with a standard mold compound is fairly easy without using any fine fillers. The trouble with these packages however is that epoxy mold compounds used typically fail Hig Temperature Reverse Bias (HTRB) testing, which exposes the device to humidity and temperature while the device is under BIAS. Devices often experience "gate leakage" under these conditions and fail catastrophically.


Furthermore, these devices are often used using a Nickel (Ni) leadframe, which is very difficult to adhere to. Therefore, epoxy moldng compound must have a very good adhesion to Nickel to achieve MSL1 preconditoning.
