shortDescription: Linqsol BCP-1034 is a thermoplastic coating powder capable of achieving a breakdown voltage of up to 80 kV/mm. It is a semi-crystalline powder that exhibits excellent fluidized bed characteristics, and due to its fluidization and low density is ideal for dip-coating applications. A distinctive feature of Linqsol BCP-1034 is that it has a virtually infinite shelf life when stored at room temperature since cross-linking is not necessary for coating. It is very easy to apply, environmentally friendly, and great for applications where low coefficient of friction and good abrasion resistance are required. This thermoplastic is used in technical and functional applications, but due to its smooth coating also has decorative applications. It is specifically developed for metal parts and accessories, like electric busbars, fuel pipes, tubes, fittings, etc. Since the BCP-1034 is reworkable, damages can be repaired with ease. Advantages of BCP-1034 Great for dip applications Excellent abrasion properties Good oil resistance Excellent melt flow High flexural modulus
