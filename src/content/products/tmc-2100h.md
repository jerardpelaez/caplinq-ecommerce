shortDescription: "OPTOLINQ TMC-2100H is an optically clear epoxy molding compound specifically designed for the encapsulation of applications that demand high moldability and optical performance. Its optimized wax formulation delivers improved self-release, enabling easier demolding and better cavity fill. OPTOLINQ TMC-2100H exhibits excellent resistance to moisture and retains stable performance under high heat and humidity. With superior processability and long-term reliability, it ensures consistent quality and precision in optoelectronic device packaging. TMC-2100H is compatible for both emitter and receiver functionality for IR-sensitive applications, where it effectively blocks near-infrared (NIR) light above 1100 nm while allowing visible light (400–700 nm) to pass—making it well-suited for ambient light sensors and other visible-light-only applications. OPTOLINQ TMC-2100H comes in different sizes to meet various mold design requirements. Contact us for custom sizes or other specific requirements. Key Features Visible Light Transmission with NIR Blocking: Enables precise sensing by allowing visible light through while filtering out NIR wavelengths (>1100 nm). Low Moisture Absorption & High Resistance: Protects device performance and longevity under damp or humid operating environments. Reliable Under Harsh Conditions: Maintains physical and optical properties at elevated temperatures and high humidity. Low Stress with High Adhesion: Reduces risk of cracking, warpage, or delamination in optoelectronic assemblies. Typical Applications Ambient light sensors Proximity/photodiode receivers (visible to ~1100 nm) Optical windows/covers for modules and cameras Low-power visible LEDs and indicators Data communication modules requiring clear optics Versions Available Standard Low stress optical molding compound - TMC-2100 Enhanced self-release, visible-pass with NIR filtering (>1100 nm) - TMC-2100H Superior IR optical transparency - TMC-2100IR Alternative to: XX-8524 Series, XX-824H, XX-330H"
