shortDescription: DetecTape™ H2 DT-H210015-PF4 is a passive colorimetric (color changing) self-fusing silicone tape designed to detect hydrogen gas (H2) leaks in fuel cell, transmission, storage, and generation facilities. When in contact with concentrated hydrogen gas, the tape color changes from light gray to dark black in the event of a leak due to damage or seal failure. DetecTape™ H2 is self fusing so it does not leave adhesive residues and bonds to itself upon contact. It is chemically and UV resistant with an operating temperature ranging from -54ºC up to +232ºC DetecTape DT-H210015-PF4 is perforated every 4 inches (10 cm) and can be used for up to 40 applications. It covers up to 40 detection points on 1/4in (6mm) average diameter pipelines or fittings. Thickness Tolerance is +/- .002 in (+/- 0.05 mm) Width Tolerance is +/- 0.125 in (+/- 3.175 mm) DetecTape™ H2 can be used on hydrogen pipelines and other objects where tape can be wrapped around itself. Application examples include but are not limited to connections, fittings, valves, welded seams, joints, flanges, and areas susceptible to vibration damage.

Detectape perforated every 10cm



### Surface preparation recommendations


Inspect intended detection point and surrounding area for contaminants. Wipe area clean of debris or fluids.


### Application instructions


STEP 1 Pull tape strip from roll up to perforation point.


STEP 2 Tear away tape strip from roll at perforation point and remove liner backing. Ensure blue guideline is facing outward for clear visibility.


STEP 3 Press tape strip firmly approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm) away from the intended detection point and begin the first wrap with one 100% complete overlap. TIP: Tightly stretching the tape around irregular contours can provide a cleaner presentation.


STEP 4 Continue stretching the tape strip while wrapping with a half overlap, using the blue guideline as half point, across desired area until approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm) past the intended detection point.


STEP 5 Finish the wrap by ending the remaining tape strip with a 100% complete final overlap. Press on wrap firmly.




### Tape removal


Use a utility knife, blade or a scissor to easily remove tape from connection. Cut away tape and dispose of in a proper trash receptacle.
