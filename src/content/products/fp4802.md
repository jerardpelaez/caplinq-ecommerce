shortDescription: LOCTITE® ECCOBOND FP4802 is a high purity, liquid, phenolic encapsulant designed for use in applications utilizing lead-free solder. This low warpage product can withstand solder reflow temperatures up to 260°C after being exposed to JEDEC level 2 (85°C/60% RH, 168hours) preconditioning. It was formulated to meet “Green” non-halide objectives of many technical users and for temperature cycling ranges up to -65 to 150°C. LOCTITE ECCOBOND FP4802 features excellent flow properties allowing the material to penetrate fine pitch wires and deep cavities without entrapping voids. A cavity or potting dam is required for flow control. LOCTITE ECCOBOND FP4802 is suitable for bare chip protection of a variety of advanced packages, such as Ball Grid Arrays (BGA’s), Chip Scale Packages (CSP’s), Plastic Ball Grid Arrays (PBGA’s), and full arrays on Low Temperature cofired Ceramic (LTCC). Cure Schedule 60minutes @ 120°C plus 120minutes @ 165°C 30minutes @ 125°C plus 90minutes @ 165°C Do not cure with a ramp rate >10°C/minute.
