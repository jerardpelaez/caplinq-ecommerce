shortDescription: LOCTITE HF 250DP solder paste is a halogen-free, no clean, low voiding Pb-free solder paste. It is a low metal content solder paste formulated for dispense applications. LOCTITE HF 250DP has been optimized to achieve consistent 250 to 300um dots using a 27 gauge needle. It contains a stable resin system and slow evaporating solvents and is suitable for nitrogen reflow. LOCTITE HF 250DP solder paste is no-clean and is designed to be left on the PCB in many applications post assembly since it does not pose a hazard to long-term reliability. Should there be a specific requirement for residue removal, this may be achieved by using conventional cleaning processes based on solvents such as MULTICORE MCF800
