shortDescription: LINQTAPE™ DCT-PET115 is a translucent polyethylene terephthalate (PET) tape used in the dicing process. It provides an excellent balance of electrical, mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties. Its strong adhesion ensures the wafer remains secure during different manufacturing processes like die-cutting. The security the tape provides prevents wafer damage, whiskers, soaking and allows for cleaner cuts. LINQTAPE™ DCT-PET115 can be peeled by using UV. To ensure a clean substrate after removing the tape, DCT-PET115 utilizes a technology through which after applying UV light, the adhesive (19,000 N/25mm) becomes less tacky (100 N/25mm), which facilitates the removal of the tape. This quality makes the tape ideal for glass and ceramic applications, and applications for which the final product must be clean of any residue. DCT-PET115 is a 100µm PET film, with a one-sided 10µm acrylic adhesive layer, and backed with a PET liner. This product can be customized according to the customer's needs.
