shortDescription: Aculon 73DE Offset is a clear fluorinated solvent blend designed for heavy-duty vapor degreasing or immersion cleaning applications. Some of the features include high solvency, low surface tension, non-flammability, and fluid stability. Vapor degreasing with Aculon 73DE fluid can help save time and costs over by offering faster cycle times, lower energy usage, and improved cleaning of parts with complex geometries. It is a direct replacement for Novec 73DE. Key Features Effective in cleaning heavy greases, oils, waxes, silicones, and non-polar flux residues. Easy maintenance and use in a vapor degreaser with stable bath composition during extended use. Non-flammable and low in toxicity. Environmentally sustainable with low global warming potential (GWP) and 0 ozone depletion potential(ODP). Replacement for Novec 73DE, nPB, TCE, ozone-depleting HCFCs, and high GWP HFCs. Effective for lubricant deposition applications where increased solvency is desired.
