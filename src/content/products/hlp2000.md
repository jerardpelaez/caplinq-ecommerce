shortDescription: Honeywell HLP2000 is a two-part, silicone-based thermal potting material designed to provide both superior heat dissipation and protective encapsulation for sensitive electronics. With a thermal conductivity of 2.0 W/m·K and low viscosity (6000 cps), it flows easily to encapsulate components, making it ideal for automotive, LED, photovoltaic, and industrial power applications. Honeywell HLP2000 cures at room temperature and can be heat-accelerated for faster processing. Beyond thermal management, HLP2000 also safeguards electronic assemblies from environmental stress—like humidity, dust, or vibration—extending the operational life and reliability of the complete module. Applications Automotive electronics Industrial power supplies Photovoltaic inverters LED modules and lighting systems

Storage and Handeling



- Shelf life: 9 months at Room Temperature

- Storage: Store in a well-ventilated area. Keep the container closed when not in use, and keep it away from direct sunlight.

- Processing: Mix at a 1:1 ratio by weight. The material cures in 24 hours at room temperature or within 1 hour at 80 °C. Before use, ensure both parts are thoroughly mixed. Store in a well-ventilated area and protect from direct sunlight. Always keep containers sealed when not in use.
