shortDescription: "LINQCELL VRB-AEM50 is a 50-µm partially fluorinated anion exchange membrane without reinforcement. It has low ohmic resistance, excellent mechanical properties, low water uptake, and minimal dimensional swelling. VRB-AEM50 has high oxidative stability, resists chlorine, and remains stable in acidic environments (pH > 4). The recommended operating temperature is from room temperature to 50 °C. LINQCELL VRB-AEM50 is highly suitable for electrochemical applications that require exceptional oxidative stability and chlorine resistance, such as redox flow batteries operating with very harsh, aqueous acidic solutions. Key Features and Benefits: Low Resistance: Facilitates efficient ion transport, minimizing energy losses and maximizing device performance. High Vanadium Ion Blocking Capability: Significantly reduces vanadium crossover in Redox-Flow Batteries, ensuring prolonged operational lifespan and enhanced efficiency. High Acidic Stability: Maintains its integrity and performance in harsh acidic conditions, crucial for applications like Vanadium-Redox-Flow Batteries (VRBs). Highly Recommended for: Vanadium-Redox-Flow Batteries (VRBs) Aqueous Acidic Redox-Flow Batteries. LINQCELL VRB-AEM50 comes in different sizes to meet various device design requirements. Contact us for custom sizes or other specific requirements."
