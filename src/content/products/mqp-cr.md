shortDescription: MQP-CR Crystalline Micro Quartz Powder consists of ultra fine crystalline silica particles with a total purity SiO2 content of 99.97%. It is commonly used as an EMC filler for semiconductors and can be used in Copper claded layers to improve its CTE, thermal resistance and reliability. MQP-CR has fewer ionic impurities and low alpha ray emissions while also maintaining a very high purity. Its ultra fine nature makes it ideal for PCB printing inks. It helps with resistance to scratching and wiping, it lowers the CTE and brings long term reliability to the circuit board. MQP-CR can finally be used in paints and coatings, assisting with the leveling properties, transparency and weather resistance of the materials. The particle size is adjusted to the customer requirements and can range from 7μm to 75μm (D50).
