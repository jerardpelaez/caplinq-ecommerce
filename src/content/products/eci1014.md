shortDescription: LOCTITE® ECI 1014 is a highly conductive, silver, high-elongation ink based on a thermoplastic polyurethane binder. This combined stretchability and high conductivity enables the development of medical wearables, smart textiles, automotive interiors, and flexible heater applications. LOCTITE® ECI 1014 can be dried at temperatures as low as 80°C (176°F). It is suitable for screen printing or high-speed printing after dilution, and compatible with solvent-sensitive substrates such as polycarbonate, polyester or thermoplastic polyurethane. Drying cycle 15 minutes @ 120°C

DIRECTIONS FOR USE


1. Surface Preparation



- Clean the surface thoroughly prior to application




2. Mixing/Dilution



- Mix thoroughly before use to ensure it is homogenous.

- Moderate heating of the ink, up to 40°C, can improve product homogeneity

- Should dilution be necessary use Dowanol DPM (CAS: 34590-94-8). Henkel recommends a maximum of 10 wt%. This should be accomplished by adding solvent at 0.5 wt% intervals by weight until desired viscosity and printability are achieved.




3. Application



- LOCTITE ECI 1014 E&C may be applied by screen printing method.

- Recommended screen and printing parameters are: Emulsion Thickness, µm: Solvent resistant 10 to 40 Squeegee Hardness 70 to 90 Screen Type, Polyester screen, cm 77-48
