### What’s the recommended dispensing process to avoid the voids?



- LE-4422 should be applied in a controlled and consistent manner. Abrupt pouring should be avoided. It is recommended to use dispensing equipment to control material flow and allow air to escape as the material fills the package.

- Recommended dispensing machine: Peristatic Dispensing Pump.

- Mold design is also a factor along with the dispense pattern being used and the dispense volume consistency.




### Precautions for use



- This product needs to be stored at low temperatures and at dry places. The shelf life will vary depending on the storage conditions.

- When the material is take out from refrigeration, thaw it first prior to use. Keep in an airtight container at room temperature. After thawing for at least 6 to 8 hours, open and then use.

- Maintain a clean and ventilated workplace, using extraction trunks when necessary.

- Wear appropriate protective equipment and minimize direct contact with the human body. Refer to the Material Safety Data Sheet (SDS) before use.




Please note that the provided information is based on available data and typical conditions. For specific applications and detailed test results, refer to the actual test data and conduct appropriate certifications.


### Storage and Handling


Store in a ventilated, dry, and clean environment below 25 °C. Keep away from fire and heat sources. It is strictly forbidden to store in outdoor environments. Shelf life can be extended by using cold storage.


What would be the effect on the product's performance after the guaranteed shelf-life? (for Failure Analysis).


Effects of using 1-part epoxy after guaranteed shelf-life:



- Changes in viscosity & flowability due to premature crosslinking

- Decrease in bonding performance




For optimal results, adhering to the recommended shelf-life and proper storage conditions is essential.
