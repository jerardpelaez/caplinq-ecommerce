shortDescription: LINQBOND LE-4832 is a one-part packaging adhesive specifically developed for semiconductor applications and can be used as an adhesive for LCD driver ICs in COB applications. It can be safely stored at 0 °C for 6 months without any degradation in quality or performance. LINQBOND LE-4832 achieves a strong hardening effect at standard room temperature. It has very stable viscosity, allowing for easy adjustment to match different glue dispensing equipment and air pressure requirements. It is stable even after thermal cycling between –55 °C and 125 °C, ensuring the integrity of IC chips even under extreme temperature conditions.

### Precautions for use



- This product needs to be stored at low temperatures and at dry places. The shelf life will vary depending on the storage conditions.

- When the material is take out from refrigeration, thaw it first prior to use. Keep in an airtight container at room temperature. After thawing for at least 6 to 8 hours, open and then use.

- Maintain a clean and ventilated workplace, using extraction trunks when necessary.

- Wear appropriate protective equipment and minimize direct contact with the human body. Refer to the Material Safety Data Sheet (SDS) before use.




Please note that the provided information is based on available data and typical conditions. For specific applications and detailed test results, refer to the actual test data and conduct appropriate certifications.


### Storage and Handling


Store in a ventilated, dry, and clean environment below 25 °C. Keep away from fire and heat sources. It is strictly forbidden to store in outdoor environments. Shelf life can be extended by using cold storage.
