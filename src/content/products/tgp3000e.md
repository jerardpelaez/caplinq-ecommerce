shortDescription: Honeywell TGP3000E Thermal Gap Filler Pads provide high thermal performance with ease of use across multitude of applications. Its ultra-high compressibility enables low stress and excellent conformity to mating surfaces. It is designed to minimize thermal resistance at interfaces, and maintain excellent performance through reliability testing. Honeywell TGP3000E is naturally tacky, and requires no additional adhesive which could inhibit thermal performance. Even though these pads come in large dimensions, it is suggested to cut and apply them in smaller pieces to ensure part uniformity and to avoid any issues related to their application. Products are available in a thickness range from 0.5mm to 5.0mm. Product Key Features Thermally Conductive (3.0W/m•K) — better heat dissipation Ultra-high compressibility for low stress applications Excellent surface wetting for low contact resistance. Applications Semiconductor logics & memory Power devices and modules Consumer electronics, telecommunications, and automotive electronics
