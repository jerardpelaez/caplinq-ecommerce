  - Enhances shock absorption
shortDescription: LOCTITE® AA 3106 is a transparent acrylic liquid, primarily designed for bonding rigid or flexible PVC to polycarbonate where large gap filling capabilities and flexible joints are desired. The product has shown excellent adhesion to a wide variety of substrates including glass, many plastics and most metals. The thixotropic nature of LOCTITE® AA 3106TM reduces the migration of liquid product after application to the substrate. LOCTITE® AA 3106 can be cured by exposure to UV and/or visible light of sufficient intensity. To obtain full cure on surfaces exposed to air, radiation @ 220 to 260 nm is also required. The speed of cure will depend upon the UV intensity and spectral distribution of the light source, the exposure time and the light transmittance of the substrates.
