shortDescription: MM-281 is a long chain maleimide terminated carboxylic acid. It is a useful intermediate for the synthesis of ester and amide linked thermoset monomers. The long alkyl chain provides flexibility and hydrophobicity ΜΜ-281 has a flexible aliphatic backbone and maleimide and carboxylic acid functional groups that aid in adhesion promotion in free-radical or in epoxy/(meth)Acrylate hybrid adhesives . It is recommended for use as an intermediate for maleimide functional resins and the main difference with the seemingly identical MM-211 is the twice as long alkyl chain.
