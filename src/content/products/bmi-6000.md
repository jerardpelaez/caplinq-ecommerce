shortDescription: "BMI-6000 has been designed as a curable, low DK and Df alternative to replace both the Kapton and adhesive layers in the manufacture of FCCL materials. The material has excellent thermal stability and workability. It is soluble in a variety of solvents such as cyclopentanone, cyclohexanone, MEK, DMF, DMAC, and NMP in combination with aromatic solvents. It can be processed in a resin system as a solid or dissolved in a solvent. BMI-6000 is recommended for use as an adhesive layer when laminating materials for FCCL applications. Adhesion promoters, solvent(s), are required for successful use. BMI6000 has much higher Tg than products such as BMI-689 and require thermal curing to obtain the published values. This material is not suitable for UV curing. Aromatic BMI resins lose some of their user-friendly nature compared to the aliphatic versions: they are less soluble in normal solvents, less compatible with other resins, require more complicated curing processes, etc. Curing BMI-6000 is typically cured using dicumyl peroxide. Please see the curing process described in the TDS. You may want to develop your own process. If so, insure all solvent is removed prior to entering the cure process window."

### What are the main differences with BMI 6100?

**BMI-6100** is a little different than 6000 in that the Tg of the resin is dependent on the temperature used to cure the material. Dicumyl peroxide can be used to speed the cure at low temperatures but the temperature of activation is too low to be useful in obtaining elevated Tg values that the material is capable of obtaining. Please see the TDS (attached) for cure suggestions. Again, BMI-6000/6100 are not suitable for UV curing.
 
We use **anisole **for the BMI-6100 for two reasons:



- The reaction to form the product is performed in anisole and for economy, we prefer to leave it in anisole

- We are unable to precipitate this higher molecular weight material to form a solid powder - it forms a gooey mess.




We can remove most of the anisole and substitute an alternative solvent (I'm not sure what would be compatible at the present time) at substantial extra cost - and the material is expensive already!. In addition, we have not been successful in removing all of the anisole before taking it back up in solvent.
