shortDescription: "LINQALLOY SAC305 solder Spheres are lead-free Tin/Silver/Copper alloys that contain 96.5% Tin (Sn), 3% Silver (Ag), and 0.5% Copper (Cu) and is often written as Sn96.5Ag3.0Cu0.5. SAC305 Solder Spheres are the least expensive of the two industry standard lead-free solder spheres (the other being SAC405) and are used by companies working with BGA, CSP, LBGA, PBGA and CBGA components who have made the transition to Lead-free (Pb-free) soldering. Features: Lowest Cost Sn/Ag/Cu Alloy Excellent Fatigue Resistance Compatible with all Flux Types Excellent Solder Joint Reliability Best Wetting Sn/Ag/Cu Alloy Each jar has a clear label on the lid specifying the solder ball diameter as well as a label on the front identifying the alloy type, the quantity of spheres in the jar, the date of manufacture, and the product lot (or batch) number. This batch number is also tied to a certificate of conformance that is also provided with the solder spheres and ensures the SAC305 solder spheres meet the following quality criteria: Tin (Sn): 96.5% Silver (Ag): 3% Copper (Cu): 0.5% Melting Temperature (Solidus): 217&deg;C Melting Temperature (Liquidus): 219&deg;C Sphericity : Within 1.5% Diameter Tolerance 0.22mm - 0.48mm (220&micro;m - 480&micro;m) : &plusmn; 0.010mm (&plusmn; 10&micro;m) 0.50mm - 0.762mm (500&micro;m - 762&micro;m) : &plusmn; 0.025mm (&plusmn; 25&micro;m)"

### 

### What is the difference between Solder paste and Solder spheres?

Technically, the reflow profiling will be more or less the same as the solder paste SAC305 but will have slight changes due to: 

- Delivery form - Solder spheres are pre-shaped balls of the solder alloy and solder paste is a pre-mixed suspension of solder particles and flux in a solvent base)

- Flux impact - Solder paste relies on the flux to activate cleaning and wetting during soldering. The reflow profile needs to consider the activation and burn-off characteristics of the flux. Solder spheres don't require flux in them internally for reflow.

- Heating methods: Solder paste is typically heated from the bottom of the PCB during reflow. Solder spheres are often heated from both the top and bottom during reflow, especially for BGA components.

### What do I get when I buy SAC305 Solder Spheres from CAPLINQ?

The advantage of ordering solder spheres online at CAPLINQ.com is that you can be sure of the quality. The solder spheres you receive are originally manufactured solder spheres packed into jars with inert gas (nitrogen). We do not repack the solder balls we receive, so the jars you will receive have never been opened, thus ensuring the quality of the product you receive. The lid of the jar is also always sealed with a shrink-wrapped plastic wrap ensuring that the solder spheres do not oxidate in the jar.
