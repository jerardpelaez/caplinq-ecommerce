shortDescription: LOCTITE ECI 7004HR E&C is a screen printable, high resistance carbon solvent-based ink. It is specifically designed to allow for blending with NCI 7002 E&C to obtain the required resistance. The blended material will provide sheet resistance adjustments required in the manufacture of force sensors with slow responsive sensitivity profiles. With a maximum operating temperature of 105ºC and a heat drying cure mechanism, this ink exhibits robust performance even under challenging conditions. LOCTITE ECI 7004HR E&C is often used to create printed resistors, including froce sensing resistor (FSR) elements, on polyester foil. With the LOCTITE NCI 7002 E&C the resistance values can be adjusted in the range of 5000 till 500.000 ohm/ sq /25 um. LOCTITE ECI 7004HR E&C finds optimal compatibility with key substrates such as treated polyester and polyimide, ensuring consistent and reliable performance across a spectrum of assembly applications. Moreover, this ink is specially engineered to facilitate blending with LOCTITE NCI 7002 E&C, allowing for sheet resistance adjustments essential for the manufacture of force sensors with slow responsive sensitivity profiles. Additionally, LOCTITE ECI 7004HR E&C is recommended for use in the assembly of printed temperature sensors, further underscoring its versatility and adaptability in addressing diverse industry needs.

LOCTITE ECI 7004HR E&C mixed with LOCTITE NCI 7002 E&C can be dried using forced air or infrared systems. Higher temperatures for longer time exposure will improve the performance. Care should be taken with infrared. Too much energy can destroy the coating. Design drying rates for the maximum the substrate and production speeds can tolerate.


The above drying profile is a guideline recommendation. Conditions (time and temperature) may vary based on customers' experience and their application requirements, as well as customer drying equipment, oven loading and actual oven temperatures.
