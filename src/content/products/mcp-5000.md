shortDescription: "LINQSOL MCP-5000 is a green epoxy coating powder with good heat resistance and electrical insulation. MCP-5000 is suitable for motor and rotor coating, also coil end encapsulation. With its low pick-up temperature and quick pick-up rate, MCP-5000 builds up quickly. LINQSOL MCP-5000 has high hardness, great edge coverage (55%), a high recovery rate, and is able to produce 15% more units compared to competitive products, with the same amount of powder. It comes into different arrangements with various particle size distributions (PSD) from 150um down to 38um. Please check the table in the additional information section. Key Features: Comparable with DK7-0953M Good adhesion to copper Fast curing and high powder build rate Excellent edge coverage, hardness, and cut-through resistance Applicable in electrostatic fluidized bed Recommended Coating Temperature: 200 °C x 15 min"

Industrial motors include power tools, home appliances and industrial motors. In automotive, motors are used for enclosures, windshield wipers, seat adjusters, window lifts and fuel pumps, quality cars can have up to 130 motors. An electric motor is made by wrapping an electric current around a magnetic core, and these two must be insulated from each other. This can be done by using insulating epoxy coating powder. Epoxy coating powders is widely used due to the advantages of efficiency and reliability. Check our Application Page Slot Insulation for more details.


 



## Insulation Epoxy Coating Powder Requirements


### Great Performance



- Excellent edge coverage

- High cut through resistance temperature (minimum 300°C)

- High service temperatures and insulation class

- Capability to provide a range of thermal conductivities




### Great Manufacturing Productivity



- High build rate enables faster coating line speed

- Outstanding adhesion to metal and plastics

- Low thickness required to achieve max performance

- Both induction and oven cure chemistries










 
  High Edge Coverage





Epoxy coating powders is likely to be cut by copper wire at the edges. Minimum 300-400um coating thickness and 40% edge coverage ratio are required. MCP-5000 has the edge coverage of 55%.






 
  High Adhesion Force





Coatings must have a perfect and consistent adhesion to the armature surface. MCP-5000 is tested great adhesion on coppper and Fe-Fe shear adhesion strength of more than 30 MPa.






 
  Low Pick Up Temperature





Lower temperature and faster cure plus great electrostatic pickup increase productivity and save money, MCP-5000 has low melting temperature as 58°C, which allows quick pick up.







Storage


Store in a ventilated, dry, and clean environment below 25°C. Keep away from fire and heat sources. It is strictly forbidden to store in outdoor environments. At proper storage conditions, the product has a shelf life of 6 months.


Precautions



- Avoid long-term skin contact. Powder that touched the skin should be rinsed off quickly.

- During operation dust-proof masks should be used to avoid inhalation.

- Keep the oven temperature stable, so as not to affect the colour and quality of the coating due to excessive temperature deviation.

- The concentration of dust should be controlled within a safe range to avoid malfunction of the coating equipment.
