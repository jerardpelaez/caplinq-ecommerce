shortDescription: LINQBOND ED-645CM is a two-component epoxy adhesive with high viscosity and thixotropic properties. These features allow it to control flow and provide sag resistance during both the working and curing processes. The cured product exhibits high toughness and excellent adhesion to different substrates such as glass, ceramics, plastics, and metals. Furthermore, LINQBOND ED-645CM offers high electrical insulation even under high humidity, grease resistance, and chemical resistance. Its hardener does not form an insoluble, whitish solid upon air exposure, and the cured surface remains free from oiliness and maintains a smooth, glossy finish LINQBONDTM ED-645CM is an ideal solution for bonding materials in different applications. Additionally, it is RoHS 2011/65/EU compliant and meets various environmental testing requirements. Product Key Features Electrically insulating — Prevents short-cuircuiting between electrical components. High viscosity and thixotropy — Provides sag resistance for working and curing processes. Reliable — Resistant against humidity, grease, and chemicals, ensuring that bonded components are protected over time. Applications General assembly of components made up of different substrates, particularly those made of glass, ceramics, plastics, and metals.

Directions for Use



- Weigh the correct proportions and mix thoroughly, scraping both the bottom and the sides of the mixing container until a homogeneous mixture is obtained.

- Ensure that the bonding surfaces are clean, dry, and properly prepared.

- Use mixed product before pot life for optimum properties. Avoid large quantity mixing. Apply adhesive evenly to both surfaces for maximum bond strength.

- Cure time depends on part geometry, materials, bond line thickness, and oven efficiency. Confirm cure schedule with production parts and equipment.
