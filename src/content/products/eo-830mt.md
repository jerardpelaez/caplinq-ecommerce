sellingPoints:
  - High crack & fatigue resistance
  - Excellent adhesion on metals
  - RoHS compliant
shortDescription: LINQBOND EO-830MT is a single-component, thermosetting epoxy adhesive formulated for robust structural bonding of metallic substrates to disparate materials, including ceramics and glass fibers. EO-830MT exhibits superior resistance to crack propagation and fatigue, coupled with high cohesive strength and tensile shear adhesion. Its material properties make it suitable for applications requiring exceptional long-term reliability and operational durability. LINQBOND EO-830MT is characterized by an extended ambient temperature working life and achieves optimal cross-linking via thermal curing at temperatures exceeding 120 °C. It also demonstrates a high thixotropic index, providing excellent sag resistance during application and post-dispense fixturing. Furthermore, this product is compliant with major environmental directives, including the RoHS 2011/65/EU Directive. Product Applications Bonding of metals to ceramics, glass fibers, and composite materials

Directions for Use





Make sure that the substrate is clean and free of contaminants, such as dirt, grease, or mold release agents. A simple solvent wipe is often sufficient.




Before use, allow the sealed container to equilibrate to room temperature (14–34 °C) for 1–2 hours.




Cure time will depend on actual production parts and equipment such as part geometry, materials, bondline thickness and the oven temperature.




Curing profiles should be considered carefully in specific application to avoid extreme heat release and consider gradually cooling to minimize the thermal stress.




For maximum bonding strength and properties, apply the adhesive evenly to one or both surfaces to be joined, increase the curing temperature or prolong the curing time.
