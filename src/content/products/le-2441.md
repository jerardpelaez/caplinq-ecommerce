shortDescription: "OPTOLINQ™ LE-2441 is a high-performance UV-curable epoxy resin developed for precision optical bonding and encapsulation. Engineered for fast and tack-free curing under 310–365 nm UV light, it offers superior optical clarity, strong adhesion, and robust thermal resistance. Its high refractive index (1.5665), >89% transmittance from 500 to 900 nm, and glass transition temperature of 157 °C make it ideal for LED optics, fiber-optic components, and sensor assemblies. LE-2441 is a solvent-free, single-component formulation with excellent flowability (viscosity: 2,500 ± 500 cP), and no pot life concerns. RoHS compliant and resistant to oxygen inhibition, it ensures stable processing and long-term performance in high-precision applications. Product Key Features Fast UV curing – Cures quickly at 310–365 nm with minimal energy. Tack-free surface – Oxygen-insensitive curing avoids surface inhibition. High optical clarity – 90% transmittance at 900 nm; ideal for light-guiding applications. Optimal refractive index (1.5665), which is ideal for optical components. High Tg (157 °C) – Excellent thermal resistance for demanding environments. Low CTE (74 ppm/°C) – Ensures dimensional stability in optical assemblies. Strong adhesion to Si, Au, die attach materials, and printed circuit board assemblies, and forms airtight seals upon curing. Solvent-free, single-component – No mixing required; easy to handle and apply. RoHS compliant – Meets EU Directive 2011/65/EU for environmental safety. Applications LED lens encapsulation and UV bonding Optical fiber and photonic component assembly Sensor and photodiode sealing Transparent coatings for display and imaging devices Precision bonding in optoelectronic modules"

Processing Instructions



- OPTOLINQ™ LE-2441 should be stored at 2–13 °C. Before use, keep the sealed container at ambient conditions for 1–2 hours. Do not open the lid until the temperature has equalised to prevent moisture condensation.

- Ensure that all application surfaces are clean, dry, and free of grease, dust, or mold-release agents. Wipe the surfaces with a suitable organic solvent to remove any contaminants that could affect the resin’s adhesion or curing performance.

- Avoid contact with substances that can inhibit curing, such as amines, amine-cured epoxies, or polyurethanes (PU). Direct or indirect exposure to these materials may reduce or completely prevent proper curing of LE-2441. It is recommended to perform compatibility testing prior to production use.

- Wear appropriate protective equipment and minimize direct contact with the human body. Refer to the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) before use.
