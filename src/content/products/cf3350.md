shortDescription: LOCTITE ABLESTIK CF 3350 epoxy assembly film adhesive is formulated for electrical, thermal and mechanical assembly applications. The combination of adhesive properties ensures reliable RF ground plane performance. It is typically used to bond circuit board materials, metal backplanes and heatsinks and can be applied on fluoropolymer, ceramic, copper, brass, kovar and aluminum substrates. On top of that, this assembly film offers a high thermal conductivity of 7 W/mK. LOCTITE ABLESTIK CF 3350 is a gray, flexible, thermally and electrically conductive film that provides electrical continuity and minimum thermal resistance to the heatsink . It meets the NASA outgassing standards and the requirements of MIL-STD-883, Method 5011 for adhesives. Cure Schedule 30 minutes @ 150°C 10 minutes @ 175°C or 50 minutes @ 137°C or 120 minutes @ 125°C

Assembly Films like LOCTITE ABLESTIK CF 3350 are used for very large dies, even up to 15mm2. These silver filled films with 7 W/mK bulk conductivity are widely used in Defense and Aerospace and other RF applications and are available in 50 and 100um thickness in 10 x 12” sheet form. These films can be cut in size and cured under a heated press up to 0.4 MPa pressure. Assembly adhesive films can be used in radar systems which are vital for improving flight safety and efficiency. Assembly of higher functioning circuit boards must consider heat build up to preserve reliability. Aerospace engineers prefer assembly films for thermal management in circuit assembly. These films remove heat from the circuit board in a safe and reliable way by connecting it to a heat sink. They evenly distribute adhesive, resulting in consistent bond lines and achieving a robust thermal management while providing a strong reliable bond and electrical grounding. These films can be custom cut into intricate preform designs by a laser, die cutter or knife plotter. This way we can have precise amounts of material placed exactly where it's needed. LOCTITE films are the industry standard and are relied on by manufacturers around the world for consistent and robust performance in aerospace assembly.
