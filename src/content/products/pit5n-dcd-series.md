shortDescription: LINQTAPE PIT5N-DCD is a 5-mil, Kapton HN Film Alternative whose high performance, flexible, high-temperature resistant polyimide films used for many high temperature applications. Polyimide is preferred over polyester for many high temperature applications. These applications include but are not limited to semiconductor, smartcard, electronic, automotive and general manufacturing industries. LINQTAPE PIT5N-DCD Series Film provides an excellent balance of electrical, mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties over a wide range of temperatures. It can be used in applications that may see temperatures up to 400°C (752°F). LINQTAPE PIT5N-DCD polyimide tape can be delivered in a range of die cut discs sizes with diameters ranging from 1/8" to 12".
