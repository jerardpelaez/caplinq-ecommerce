shortDescription: LOCTITE® DSP 190024 is an acrylated urethane, primarily designed for bonding rigid and flexible PVC to polycarbonate where large gap filling capabilities (0.25mm) and a flexible joint are desired. Its flexibility enhances the load bearing and shock absorbing characteristics of the bond area. The product has shown excellent adhesion to a wide variety of substrates including glass, many plastics and most metals and is used as a UV curable sealant for displays. In that sense it is quite similar to LOCTITE 3703. The thixotropic nature of LOCTITE® DSP 190024™ reduces the migration of liquid product after application to the substrate. LOCTITE® DSP 190024 can be cured by exposure to UV and/or visible light of sufficient intensity. Surface cure is enhanced by exposure to UV light in the 220 to 260 nm range. Cure rate and ultimate depth of cure depend on light intensity, spectral distribution of the light source, exposure time and light transmittance of the substrate through which the light must pass.
