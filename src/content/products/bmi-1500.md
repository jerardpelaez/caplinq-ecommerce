sellingPoints:
  - Soluble in many reactive diluents
  - High adhesion to various substrates
  - Superior thermal stability
shortDescription: BMI-1500 is an amorphous, low molecular weight bismaleimide oligomer that exhibits good adhesion to a variety of substrates. It can be homo-cured via UV or free radical initiators to form tough, hydrophobic, cross-linked polyimides. The material has excellent low pH hydrolytic resistance and thermal stability. The amorphous nature of this imide-extended BMI allows it to form room-temperature-stable solutions in a variety of free radical reactive diluents. It is soluble in many common solvents such as toluene, xylene, MIBK, etc. BMI-1500 is recommended for use as an additive or base resin in adhesives that are designed for high temperature resistance. It has excellent adhesion to a variety of substrates. When used as a base resin, it can produce adhesives that are tough, flexible and demonstrate good peel strength.

BMI 1400 and BMI 1500 oligomers do not lend themselves to a similar "clean-up/purification" as we did with BMI-689. Despite that, 1400/1500 would likely benefit from the use of some coupling agents - especially as it relates to the post 85/85 adhesion values. These BMI resins are very hydrophobic and have high hydrolytic resistance, meaning water does not degrade the resin.


BMI resins, unless they are used with epoxies or other co-resins, do not have good adhesion to metals and they do have a large void volume. This void volume allows moisture to penetrate to the surface where the adhesion is not so good and further degrade it. However, with the proper use of coupling agents, the interface adhesion is improved and the 85/85 adhesion will follow.


### What is the shelf life of the material?


DMI warrants the material for 1 year from the date of shipment when stored cold (+5ºC). This period is specified more to encourage customers to use the material and protect DMI from product returns as opposed to some chemical instability in the material. In fact, DMI stores the bulk BMI-1500 at room temperature prior to shipment. The absolute shelf life is many years - especially if stored cold and away from light - but we have never come up with a specific number of years.




### What is the best temperature profile to thermally cure BMI-1500?

Because BMI-1500 (and most other DMI oligomer resins) are relatively large molecules (especially when compared to epoxy monomers) with limited reactive sites which yields limited cross-linking during polymerization it is DMI's belief that thermal curing will give a more complete cure vs. UV. In our experience the degree of cure in UV at low temperatures is limited by the molecular freedom - where as thermal cure uses the heat energy to encourage additional bonds to form. We recommend thermal curing when possible - or even adding a "thermal bump" to a UV process to help complete the cure.
 
The temperature of cure is related to the thermal catalyst employed. Our preferred thermal catalyst is dicumyl peroxide. This material is very stable and only starts to decompose and initiate the polymerization reaction a about 135ºC with a reaction peak at around 155ºC. When using this catalyst we suggest taking the material to 175ºC (or even 200ºC if possible) for an hour to cure the material as much as possible and avoid any surface tackiness cause by oxygen poisoning at the surface.
 
Of course, there are many different free radical catalysts available - many of which perform at lower temperatures. With these catalysts you need to consider storage conditions, pot life concerns, etc. to insure the material doesn't pre-polymerize before the desired time.
