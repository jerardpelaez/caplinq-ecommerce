shortDescription: "OPTOLINQ OLS-1000 is a two-part (Part A & Part B), optically clear epoxy casting compound designed for the encapsulation of LED lamps and displays. It features excellent UV resistance, high optical transmittance, high adhesion to a range of substrates, and good thermal shock resistance. It is geared specifically for applications that will not be exposed to temperatures above 125°C, and where the cost of the encapsulation material is a large percentage of the final part cost. The OLS-1000 has been value-engineered to provide the minimum level of acceptable performance for the absolute lowest cost. OPTOLINQ OLS-1000 has been used extensively for low-power LED encapsulation, automatic LED casting, and potting of large optoelectronic modules. Each of these applications relies on the high clarity and other optical properties of the OLS-1000 as well as its excellent mechanical properties. The OLS-1000 can be colored and diffused by the addition of specific dye concentrates and diffusant concentrates. This product is not made for SMD encapsulation but mainly for DIP packages. Newer Versions with improved optical and mechanical performance: OPTOLINQ OLS-1000HF OPTOLINQ OLS-1000LV OPTOLINQ OLS-1000HV"

Additional Handling Instructions





Preheat Part A to 40°C and then mix in Part B in the required mixing ratio given above. Ideally, the mixture of Part A and B will be done in a vacuum and degassed at 3 torr (400 Pa) for 10-15 minutes. This will ensure that all the entrapped air bubbles are removed after mixing. For best results, ensure that all moisture has been removed from the parts to be encapsulated by preheating them for 1 hour @ 90°C. Also for best results, the encapsulation should be carried out in a vacuum.


Using Additives with OLS-1000


Optolinq OLS-1000 can be mixed with diffusing agents or color pastes to achieve customer-specific purposes.


Recommended quantity (in weight %) of various diffusing agents and color pastes to be used with OLS-1000:



- OCP01-R Red Color Paste: 2-5% by weight

- OCP01-B Blue Color Paste: 1-3% by weight

- OCP01-G Green Color Paste: 2-4% by weight

- ODF-10 Diffusing Agent: 2-5% by weight




Values with our latest pastes and agents TBD.


Storage and Handling


OPTOLINQ OLS-1000 is supplied in cans and jars and should be kept in a cool (10°C – 25°C) dry place (40% – 75% humidity) away from direct sunlight or temperature extremes. Part B is particularly sensitive to moisture, so be sure to remove moisture after using and to keep the lid of the container tightly sealed after use.
