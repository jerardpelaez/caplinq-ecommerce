shortDescription: "LINQSOL BCP-1504 is a blue or red, busbar epoxy coating powder. It applies at low voltage copper and alumina busbars (600V) with a coating thickness of 0.3~1mm. With its low pick up temperature, BCP-1504 builds up quickly at small busbars and performs excellent coating results. It brings high productivity with low pre-heat temperature and quick curing. Due to its fine-grind process, it can be used with both electrostatic spray and fluidized bed dipping. Key Features: Comparable with DK15-0463 Good adhesion to copper, alumina Low pick up temperature High powder build rate Both electrostatic spray and fluidized bed coating Recommended coating Temperature: 150 – 180 °C. (200 °C x 15 min)"

OBSERVATION



- Coating appearance: Smooth, no-dripping, great edge coverage

- Coating process: Quick build rate on thickness, low pick up temperature;

- Preheat temperature: 240°C preheat temperature with 1 dip reaches 0.5mm, which is thicker than 1 dip @200°C, but appears small-size sag. With multiple dips, the surface becomes smooth again.






DISCUSSION


BCP-1504 presents good coating results with preheat temperature 200°C. BCP-1504 has low pickup temperature and it is designed to coat on small size busbar with quick build rate.







BCP-1504 Powders In Fluidized Bed




### Storage


Store in a ventilated, dry, and clean environment below 25°C. Keep away from fire and heat sources. It is strictly forbidden to store in outdoor environments. At proper storage conditions, the product has a shelf life of 6 months.


Precautions





Avoid long-term skin contact. Powder that touched the skin should be rinsed off quickly.




During operation dust-proof masks should be used to avoid inhalation.




Keep the oven temperature stable, so as not to affect the colour and quality of the coating due to excessive temperature deviation.




The concentration of dust should be controlled within a safe range to avoid malfunction of the coating equipment.
