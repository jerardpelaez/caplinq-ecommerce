shortDescription: LOCTITE ECCOBOND UF 3812 reworkable epoxy underfill is designed for CSP, WLCSP and BGA applications. This low viscosity material is formulated to flow at room temperature with no additional preheating required. It cures quickly at moderate temperatures to minimize stress to other components. This material's high glass transition temperature and high fracture toughness enables excellent protection of solder joints during thermal cycling. LOCTITE ECCOBOND UF 3812 exhibits stable electrical performance under thermal/humidity bias is compatible with most Pb-free solder and has excellent thermal cycling performance.

### What are the benefits of a reworkable underfill?


Working with a reworkable underfill post cure will demonstrate the following:



- The substrate has low residue after package de- bonding

- The underfill has low adhesion to the solder mask making mechanical scraping easy

- After cleaning, board surface is almost residue free




When we are using a non reworkable underfill on the other hand:



- Board surface shows >50% residue after package de-bonding. De-bonding also damages the substrate

- After cleaning, the board surface residue is 40% with 10% solder mask damage




It goes without saying that a reworkable underfill is highly preferred for applications that might require reworking at any point of their lifespan (for example repairing expensive motherboards or fine tuning already assembled parts)
