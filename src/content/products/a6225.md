shortDescription: A-6225 is a proprietary, patent-pending non-halogenated additive utilizing a monofunctional silicone together with a thiol reactive group allowing it to perform multiple functional roles. When used in metal filled and non-metal filled adhesive systems it reduces resin bleed out on a variety of surfaces such as with copper and gold traces. When used as a mold release in composite manufacturing the material imparts a residual anti-stiction silicone coating to surface of the parts. A-6225 is co-curable in both free-radical based and traditional epoxy based polymerization systems. It can also enhance the rheological properties of various filled adhesives. A-6225 is recommended for use as an additive to reduce resin bleed out specifically on metal surfaces. The recommended addition of the A-6225 to a formulation is between 2% - 5% weight percent of resin. It shows superior bleed control in silver filled formulations and can significantly reduce or eliminate resin bleed out in formulations that contain non-metal fillers such as silica. A-6225 may be applied up to full strength to molds or incorporated at 2 – 4% weight percent in resin formulations to provide mold release and surface anti-stiction properties.

Epoxy Resin Incompatibility


A6225 rely on thiol functionality to bond in and prevent bleeding. Unfortunately thiol group react with epoxy resin instead of substrate reducing or even eliminating the resin bleed functionality.




Molecular Weight Estimation


We do not specifically measure the M.W. for this material and instead rely on the average M.W. of the starting material and the functionality (thiol group) that makes the product.
