### Flux Application

959T can be applied to circuit boards by a spray, foam, or dip process. Flux deposition should be 120 to 240ug of solids/cm2 (750 to 1500 ug/in2). An air knife after the flux tank is recommended to remove excess flux from the circuit board and prevent dripping on the preheated surface.
