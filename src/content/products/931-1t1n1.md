shortDescription: LOCTITE&reg; ECCOBOND 931-1T1N1 die attach adhesive is designed for smart card applications. This clear, low viscosity epoxy develops extraordinary adhesion on substrates such as glass, Alumina, Ferrite, Aluminum and steel after a low temperature cure. It has low ionics and is fairly stable when exposed to printing inks. LOCTITE&reg; ECCOBOND 931-1T1N1 is used as a die attach for smartcards to bond the wire bonded module onto the plastic card using low temperature cure. It's also being used in multiple bond lines, in assembling inkjet and thermal printer heads, for die attach and for assembling several other components (metal, ceramic and some plastics) around the print head. LOCTITE&reg; ECCOBOND 931-1T1N1 is fairly transparent at least in thin layers, although there is no spec or control over the optical properties. It is an epoxy, so becomes more yellow on aging at high temperature. It is very reactive, with short work life & critical storage conditions. It is corrosive and a strong skin sensitizer, so should be kept away from skin & eyes. And in pre-mixed form it is strongly exothermic. The SADT temperature is low, so it cannot be transported by air, and there are severe restrictions on shipping by road & sea. Having said that, it fully makes up for those with its end properties and for special applications it can make a difference. Recommended Cure Schedule 2 hours @ 100&deg;C 2 hours @ 60&deg;C
