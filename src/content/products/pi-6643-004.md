shortDescription: "PI-6643-004 is a high-heat insulating polyimide ink specially designed to meet the demands of high thermal applications, which provide solutions for heat resistance and insulation applications. PI-6643-004 is engineered to be a thermally curable polyimide ink with remarkable insulating properties making it an ideal choice for electrical isolation and heat management applications. Its polyimide-based chemistry brings forth the balance between flexibility and resilience. With a high Tg of 395°C, this enabled high resistance features that can withstand extreme heat conditions. Moreover, this ink has a mere 2% water absorbance, making it impervious to moisture-induced vulnerabilities. Its reliability remains intact even in environments with varying humidity levels. This ink can also be utilised as a Removable, structural material, as long as it is cured at a temperature of ±100°C. If you fully cure it, to get its insulating ink properties, then it is not solubable, etchable or generally removable anymore. Industry Applications: Aerospace Engineering | Electronics Manufacturing | High Temperature Sensors | Industrial Furnace Components Cure condition 350⁰C in 30 min"

PI-6643 has been used in Power-IC with Cu wiring.


Printing with SiN, Cu, and Au is affected by the roughness of each metal surface, but beyond that, it is also greatly affected by the ink volume of the inkjet head, the printing resolution, and the heating of the substrate - something that the inkjet equipment manufacturer can confirm.
