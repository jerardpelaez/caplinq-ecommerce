shortDescription: LOCTITE DA 100 is a dispensing grade solder paste intended for solder die-attach applications. It provides effective thermal control for copper leadframe power semiconductor devices, such as rectifiers, power transistors, and is suitable for automotive and consumer packages. Careful control of the atomisation process for production of solder powders for LOCTITE DA 100 solder pastes ensures that the solder paste produced meets the requirements of J-STD-005 for powder shape, size distribution, and alloy composition. It comes in various alloys but we only offer the 92A Lead free version. LOCTITE DA 100 features low color residues that are resistant to charring in reflow. Residues are soft and designed to be easily removed in solvent or semi aqueous cleaning processes. Its vacuum mixing makes it ideal and reliable for dispensing processes. The extended pause time capability (±2 hours) along with the robust flux makes this an excellent choise for lead free die attach designs.

Storage: Cartridges of LOCTITE DA 100 solder paste should be stored tip-downwards at ≤-18°C and have a shelf life of 365 days. Cartridges stored tip-down at 5 to 10°C have a shelf-life of 91days. Cartridges of solder paste require stabilization at room temperature before use for 1.5 to 2 hours on removal from cold storage. Once in use the paste cartridges have a floor life of 3 to 4 days at room temperature.
