shortDescription: "Aculon’s patented hydrophilic surface treatments come into their own in environments and conditions characterized by the need for a lubricious or water-attracting surface. Our range of hydrophilic technologies, AcuWet™, services a wide array of applications and durability requirements. Aculon serves as a partner to many healthcare companies seeking to create lubricious surfaces on medical devices. Many of our innovative hydrophilic technologies are biocompatible and improve performance in many medical devices. Additionally, our coatings are very easy to apply; many requiring only the submersion of the part in our coating for 30 seconds to be fully functional (with no cure). Advantages of AcuWet 470 Hydrophilic coating Provides a hydrophilic coating Easy to apply Hydrated coating repels oil Excellent chemical bonding to many surfaces Does not leach from surfaces after application and drying Easily create a hydrophilic surface Non-fouling of surfaces to oil Microfluidic channels Anti-fouling properties to biological materials Application Techniques Surface Preparation/Cleaning: Ensure that the surface is free of any grease, fingerprints, adhesive residues or dirt. This can be accomplished by first degreasing the surface with solvents or by rinsing with IPA. Contact Aculon if you are unsure what cleaner to use and we will recommend one best suited for your application. Substrates should be coated after cleaning as soon as possible to minimize the potential for recontamination. Treatment Application: Dispense: Dispense product over the surface. Apply enough material to coat the surface. Allow excess material to drain. Buff to clear coating if desired with a clean room wipe. Dip: Immerse the substrate in the solution for 20 seconds, air dry till solvent evaporated. Recommended dip containers are stainless steel, glass or aluminum. Buff to clear coating if desired with a clean room wipe. Wipe: Moisten a clean room wipe in the solution and wipe apply to the substrate. Buff to clear coating if desired. Drying: Allow the film to set at room temperature until the solvent has evaporated. Cure the part for 10 min at 60°C. Testing Hydrophilicity: Allow the coated parts to rest and hydrate for 2 hours prior to testing. Allow droplets of water to fall onto the surface, the water will wet out the substrate within seconds. If the surface is not hydrophilic clean the surface again and reapply. Option - Disperse Dispense product over the surface. Apply enough material to coat the surface. Utilization of multiple options Please note that many customers have found significant success utilizing two or more of the available NanoProof® technologies successfully. Often times the most sensitive components benefit from the most robust NanoProof® technology (5.1) while the remaining components can be coated with the less robust coatings to benefit from their electrical push through capability, flexible nature and lower costs! Detection/Inspection All NanoProof products contain a UV Tracer which is visible under 365nm wavelength UV light (Detectable by both the human eye and automated detection systems). Please note that soldermasks and other substrate materials containing a UV tracer may make accurate detection of NanoProof difficult."
