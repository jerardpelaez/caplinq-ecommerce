shortDescription: Nanoproof 8.4 is a simple, one-step treatment that is capable of imparting hydrophobicity to a wide variety of surfaces. It is designed for the treatment of metals, semiconductors, and polymers. Nanoproof 8.4 is typically applied by dip, but can also be sprayed or applied through flow treatment. It results in a hydrophobic film with properties designed to protect electronic circuitry from immersion in water. There are two versions for Nanoproof 8.4, Nanoproof 8.4S which is specifically made for spray applications, and Nanoproof 8.4A, which is made for dip/dispensing applications. Nanoproof 8.4 is PFAS free while 8.4A and 8.4S is not. Advantages of Aculon's NanoProof 8.4 More forgiving during application Dispense, spray, or dip applied ”Push through connectivity” capability No cure required RoHS and REACH compliant More effective barrier than Nanoproof 5.1 and is designed for applications requiring extreme levels of protection Utilization of multiple options Please note that many customers have found significant success utilizing two or more of the available NanoProof® technologies successfully. Often times the most sensitive components benefit from the most robust NanoProof® technology (5.1) while the remaining components can be coated with the less robust coatings to benefit from their electrical push through capability, flexible nature and lower costs! Detection/Inspection All NanoProof products contain a UV Tracer which is visible under 365nm wavelength UV light (Detectable by both the human eye and automated detection systems). Please note that solder masks and other substrate materials containing a UV tracer may make accurate detection of NanoProof difficult.

### How to apply NanoProof 1.0






STEP 1 ⇨ CLEAN




STEP 2 ⇨ TREAT




STEP 3 ⇨ DRY






Parts must be **sufficiently clean** before treatment for proper bonding and effective application. This can be accomplished by first degreasing the surface with solvents/rinsing with IPA.


Dip - Fully immerse the part in the treatment solution for 20 seconds. Withdraw the part at a steady rate to ensure even coverage. Allow to air dry.






To dry, the part should be placed at room temperature until the solvent is evaporated. It should leave an oily coating that is deformable to the touch. In some cases, additional thermal treatment (e.g. 100°C for 5 minutes) will speed solvent evaporation.
















Dispense - Dispense the treatment over the surface, applying enough to coat the entire surface. Allow excess material to drain.






### 




### Application Tips



- In some cases, Kyzen cleaners like Ionox I3s416 or Cybersolv 141-R may be appropriate for removing surface contamination.

- For dip applications, dip containers should be stainless steel, glass, or aluminum. Plastic containers are likely to contaminate the solution.

- Use a microfiber cloth to wipe after cleaning.

- Coat the substrate as soon as possible after cleaning to prevent recontamination.

Spray Equipment Suggestion


- Spray & Dispense Valve - The PVA FCS300 Valve has been tested and confirmed compatible with all NanoProof products.

- Manual Coating System - The PVA MCCS-SYS-1 Manual Conformal Coating System has been tested and confirmed compatible with all NanoProof products.

- Automated & Selective Coating - The PVA Delta 8 Selective Coating / Dispensing System has been tested and confirmed compatible with all NanoProof Products.




- Cure temperatures and conditions should be optimized based on substrate and durability requirements.

- Methylcyclohexane can be used as a diluent for Nanoproof 8.4A








### How to test for Hydrophobicity


To test for hydrophobicity, allow water droplets to fall onto the surface, which should bead up to a contact angle >100⁰. If the contact angle is
