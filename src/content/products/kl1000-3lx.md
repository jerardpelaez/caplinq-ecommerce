shortDescription: Hysol KL1000-3LX is a black, semiconductor grade epoxy molding compound. It provides the lowest cost of ownership for an epoxy molding compound. It offers superior moldability and high reliability. This material is designed to satisfy JEDEC Level 4 requirements for reflow at 220 °C. Hysol KL1000-3LX has a history that predates the acquisition of Huawei Electronics by Henkel. In 2005, Henkel formed a joint-venture with HuaweI Electronics in China to create Henkel Huawei Electronics (HHE) in Lianyungang China. HHE made low-end, halogen containing epoxy molding compounds that used Bromine or Antimony as a flame retardant. The KL1000-3LX is an old product that is still made at Hysol Huawei today. It meets UL94 V-0 flammability at a thickness of 3.175 mm. Hysol KL1000-3LX is a halogen-containing, legacy product that has been used for decades with great success for bridge rectifiers, axial packages, dual in line (DIP), TO packages, system in package (SiP), and SMX packages.

### Storage


Keep the product in its sealed container within a dry environment. Material that has been taken out of its containers can become contaminated while in use. Please refrain from putting the product back into the original container. Powder or preforms must be stored in sealed containers at temperatures of 5 ºC or lower. When taking the material out of cold storage, it is crucial to allow it to reach room temperature inside the sealed container to prevent moisture contamination. For a standard 15 kg carton box, a recommended waiting time is 24 hours.
