Instructions for Use



- Ensure parts are clean, dry and free from contaminants such as oil and grease.

- Apply product to one side and hold parts until handling strength is achieved. Ensure there is adequate, even pressure between parts. A sufficient bond is formed in less than a minute and maximum strength is attained in 24 hours.

- Wipe off excess adhesive from the top of the container and recap. Avoid exposure to air as moisture may degrade the adhesive.
