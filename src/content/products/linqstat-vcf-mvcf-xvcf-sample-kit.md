  - Complete package with Conductive and Antistatic
  - Carbon loaded PE film with low surface resistivity
shortDescription: "We offer a range of carbon loaded polyethylene (PE) based LINQSTAT-branded electrically conductive and antistatic plastic film. Our electrically conductive plastics start with a surface resistivity of less than 200,000 ohm-per-square and can go as low as 200 ohms-per-square. LINQSTAT&trade; VCF, MVCF and XVCF Series electrically conductive plastic sheeting is a black, carbon-filled, volume-conductive polyethylene film designed to provide both physical and static protection in numerous semiconductor, electronics, and Smartcard applications. The different grade of materials allows users to cover a wide range of possible applications. A common application of the conductive polyethylene films is as a pressure sensor. The LINQSTAT MVCF films can be used as a weak pressure sensor making it useful for applications that have large surface areas and expect large pressure applications. The LINQSTAT XVCF films are used for more sensitive pressure sensor applications. LINQSTAT VCF with lower conductivity levels are perfect for antistatic packaging plastic, for example as an antistatic interleaver for smartcard (micromodule) applications. It&rsquo;s antistatic properties make the Linqstat films also well suited for EMI and RF shielding applications. The Sample package includes 1 A4 size sheet of: MVCF-8S10K MVCF-4S50K XVCF-3S500 XVCF-3.5S200 XVCF-4S500 Sample kit contents are subject to change based on stock availability at the time of order."
