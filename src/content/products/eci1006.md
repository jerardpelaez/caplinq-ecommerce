DIRECTIONS FOR USE


1. Surface Preparation



- No surface treatment is needed for ITO or etched ITO substrates.




2. Mixing/Dilution



- Mix thoroughly before use to ensure it is homogenous.

- Avoid rapid stirring, as this causes air entrapment.

- If needed, the ink can be diluted with up to 1 to 2% by weight maximum with DBE (dibasic ester). The solvent should be mixed in thoroughly, including scraping the sides of the container, for over a minute until it is homogenous and streak free.




3. Application



- LOCTITE ECI 1006 E&C is designed for fine line screen printing application.

- Recommended screen and printing parameters are: Stainless Steel Screen, mesh 400 Emulsion Thickness , µm 10 to 12 Polyurethane Squeegee, durometer D90 Print Speed, in/sec 7 to 10 Snap-off Distance, mils 50 to 80
