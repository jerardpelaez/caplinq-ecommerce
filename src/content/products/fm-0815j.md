shortDescription: Silaplane FM-0815J is a trimethoxy silyl terminated PDMS designed to increase filler loadings improving performance proerties in silicone systems. Moreover, it is also used as a PFAS-free alternative showing equal to improved performance compared to F-containing systems. Among the other Silaplane products, FM-0815J has siloxane chains and alkoxysilyl groups that has the ability to chemically bond to the surface of the inorganic filler thus stabilizing the filler dispersion. It is also effective in reducing viscosity of filer dispersions better than silane coupling agents. Functions excellently alongside silicone oil. Suitable for use with epoxies and polyurethane.

SilaplaneTM FM-0815J is a dispersant with stronger filler adsorption.


Features:



- Lowers the viscosity of dispersion maintaining the thermal conductivity with the same filler filling ratio.

- Increases the heat dissipation performance (thermal conductivity) by further increasing the filler filling ratio.

- SilaplaneTM is effective in reducing the viscosity of alumina-filled dispersions and sufficiently lowers viscosity even at low addition concentrations.






### Unique adsorption properties of FM-0815J:


Silaplane TM (FM-04 series, FM-DA series) The hydroxy groups of SilaplaneTM physically adsorb to the filler by hydrophilic interaction with the hydroxy groups on the filler surface.






(New) FM-0815J The alkoxysilyl groups of FM-0815J chemically bond to the hydroxy groups on the filler surface, resulting in strong chemisorption to the filler.




### PFAS Information


Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of man-made chemicals that contain fluorine atoms. They are known for their unique properties, including their resistance to heat, water, and oil. PFAS can be found in a wide range of products, including firefighting foams, non-stick cookware, water-repellent fabrics, and more.


"F-containing systems" is a broader term that can refer to any system or material that contains fluorine (F) atoms. This can include PFAS but is not limited to them. F-containing systems can encompass a wide variety of compounds and materials that incorporate fluorine in their chemical structure.


In summary, PFAS is a specific category of chemicals that contain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, while "F-containing systems" is a more general term that includes any system or material that contains fluorine atoms, not limited to PFAS.
