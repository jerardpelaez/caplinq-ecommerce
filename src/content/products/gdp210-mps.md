shortDescription: "LINQCELL GDP210-MPS is a 210-µm thick graphitized carbon fiber paper made from high-quality polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers. The fibers undergo a wet-laying process to form a non-woven, fibrous, and porous structure, which is then carbonized and graphitized. The material undergoes high-temperature graphitization at 2000 °C, resulting in superior electrical conductivity, high oxidation resistance, and excellent thermal stability. This elevated temperature further enhances the electrical performance and compressibility of the material compared to the standard LINQCELL GDP210-MP (produced at 1600 °C), although it significantly increases production costs. LINQCELL GDP210-MPS is particularly recommended when minimizing resistivity is critical. It is an excellent choice as a gas diffusion layer in fuel cells and as a gas diffusion substrate for carbon dioxide electrolyzers. You can check our blog to find out how graphitization affects the structure and properties of carbon papers. LINQCELL GDP210-MPS has a microporous layer and PTFE coating, which provide hydrophobicity and increased surface area. The higher surface area maximizes catalyst utilization, which increases fuel cell efficiency. Meanwhile, the hydrophobic properties improve water removal and ensure stable operation by preventing flooding within the stack. Key Features: 210-µm Thickness: Optimized for reduced stack volume and internal resistance. High-Temperature Graphitization (2000 °C): Provides excellent electrical conductivity, oxidation resistance, and thermal stability. Microporous Layer & PTFE Coating: Enhances hydrophobicity, increases surface area, and optimizes catalyst utilization. Improved Water Management: Hydrophobic properties prevent flooding and ensure stable operation by enhancing water removal. High Compressibility and Porosity: Can be compressed down to 120 µm at 3.5 MPa (350 N/cm2). Highly Recommended As: Gas diffusion layers of fuel cells, particularly proton exchange membrane fuel cells Gas diffusion substrates of carbon dioxide electrolyzer electrodes LINQCELL GDP210-MPS is available in sheet form only. LINQCELL Graphitized Carbon Fiber Papers with MPL and PTFE treatment are offered in a standard width of 40 cm. Contact us for custom sizes or other specific requirements."
