shortDescription: This product was discontinued at the end of Q2 2022. If you are looking for an alternative for this cornerbond material you can look into LOCTITE 3515. LOCTITE 3515 has a faster curing speed than 3508NH. LOCTITE 3515 was originally designed to cure together with SnPb solder reflow profile (~245 Celsius) and 3508NH was designed for Pb free SAC solder reflow profile (~260 Celsius). LOCTITE® 3508NH is designed to cure during Pb-free solder reflow while allowing self-alignment of IC components. It can be pre-applied to the board at the corners of the pad site using a standard SMA dispenser. LOCTITE® 3508NH is a halogen free reworkable "Cornerbond" underfill that eliminates post reflow dispenses and cure steps while also improving mechanical reliability of handheld devices. Cure Schedule Pb-free solder reflow profile @ 245°C With all curing systems, the time required for cure depends on the rate of heating. Conditions where a hot plate or a heat sink is used are optimum for fastest cure. Cure rates depend on the mass of material to be heated and intimate contact with the heat source. Use suggested cure conditions as general guidelines. Other cure conditions may yield satisfactory results.
