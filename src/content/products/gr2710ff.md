shortDescription: Hysol GR2710FF is a gold (yellow) fine-filler semiconductor-grade epoxy molding compound designed for the encapsulation and protection of Conductive Polymer type, Tantalum capacitors. Once molded and post-mold cured, this product provides optimum protection and reliability for these capacitor devices. It is a fine-filler version of GR2710. Hysol GR2710FF is designed for Polymer Conductive and Aluminum Organic Capacitors. These devices offer very high capacitance in a very small size. Epoxy molding compounds designed for these capacitors must have very low stress and very good thin wall crack resistance as they should be able to pass the MSL performance on these package types. That's why GR2710FF exhibits both low stress and excellent thin wall crack resistance. Hysol GR2710FF is an environmentally "green" product, meaning that it doesn't contain any halogens including bromine, antimony or phosphorus flame retardants and replaces, halogen containing, older generation products. This material is designed to achieve JEDEC Level 1 requirements at 260°C reflow temperature on Aluminum Organic (AO) capacitors as well as conductive polymer capacitors. Its fast cure time also ensures that it is compatible with the latest automold manufacturing equipment. Hysol GR2710FF meets UL 94 V-0 Flammability at 1/4 inch (6.35mm) thickness.
