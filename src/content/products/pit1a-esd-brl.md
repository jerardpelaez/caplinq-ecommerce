shortDescription: "LINQTAPE PIT1A-ESD-BRL is a high-temperature resistant, antistatic-treated polyimide tape with an electro-static discharge designed for both permanent and temporary bonding in many high-temperature applications. With an acrylic adhesive, this tape has the same mechanical properties as our standard PIT1A-Series products but is black and has a 1µm conductive polymer that provides electro-static discharge and makes the tape anti-static. LINQTAPE PIT1A-ESD-BRL tapes get their conductivity by being carbon-loaded. As such the film provides both thermal conductivity as well as antistatic control with a surface resistance of less than 10E9 ohms per square. This product is an alternative to Kapton XC film with an acrylic adhesive layer. This version comes with a release liner, ensuring that the adhesive won't dry. The non-release liner product has been discontinued. Please contact us for more widths. Key Features: Excellent insulating properties Carbon-loaded conductivity Designed for permanent and temporary bonding Acrylic adhesive"
