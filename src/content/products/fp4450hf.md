apiId: 2308
name: LOCTITE ECCOBOND FP4450HF
slug: fp4450hf
sku: FP4450HF
brand: CAPLINQ
category: liquid-encapsulants
subcategory: liquid-encapsulants
sellingPoints:
  - Excellent corrosion resistance
  - Low filler size
  - Self levelling - Low alpha
shortDescription: LOCTITE® ECCOBOND FP4450HF Fill encapsulant is designed for protection of bare semiconductor devices. Autoclave performance on live devices is greater than 1,000 hours with no failure, depending upon device and package type. The use of synthetic fused silica yields very low alpha particle emissions suitable for memory devices. A cavity or potting dam is required for flow control. LOCTITE® ECCOBOND FP4450HF is a higher Tg version with a much lower filler cut size of 25um. It is admittedly a better product than FP4450, but much newer and therefore comes in lower package volumes and the price is slightly higher. Moisture uptake is expected to be comparable to FP4450. Its fine filler size, along with the lower viscosity make it indeed a "HF" High flow product. Recommended Cure Schedule 30 minutes @ 125°C plus 90 minutes @ 165°C

### How does this product fare compared to the rest of the close FP family?


FP 4450HF resin system is closest to 4450 and we can consider 4450HF as smaller filler particle size version of 4450 (


We have internal information showing that these legacy semiconductor liquids pass UL94HB at 1/8” thickness but do not have the test data or yellow card nor are we going to test for it. This is anecdotal but, hopefully, helpful.




No available data for Dielectric strength. According to our scientists a highly silica filled encapsulant will have a range of 20 to 40Kv/mm.
