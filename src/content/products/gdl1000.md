shortDescription: "LINQCELL GDL1000 is a 1.00-mm thick graphitized carbon fiber paper made from high-quality polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers. These fibers undergo a wet-laying paper process using a specially formulated carbonizable resin, resulting in a non-woven, fibrous, and porous structure, which is then carbonized and graphitized for enhanced performance. GDL1000 exhibits high electrical conductivity due to high-temperature treatment above 1000 °C, good oxidation resistance, and excellent thermal stability. Key Features: Low electrical resistance (TP Resistance = 11.11 mΩ⋅cm2) High porosity Good oxidation resistance Excellent thermal stability These characteristics make LINQCELL GDL1000 highly recommended for use as cathode porous transport layers in PEM and/or AEM water electrolyzers, as well as gas diffusion layers in fuel cells. Highly Recommended for: Cathode porous transport layer for PEM, AEM water electrolyzers Gas diffusion layer for fuel cells LINQCELL GDL1000 is graphitized at 1600 °C but can also be produced at a higher graphitization temperature (2000 °C) to meet high-performance device requirements. Higher graphitization results in better electrical performance while significantly increasing the material cost. It is mainly recommended when resistivity is of the utmost importance."
