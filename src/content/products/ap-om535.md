shortDescription: ALPHA OM-535 features a low-temperature solder paste technology that enables a single reflow application for the assemby of double-sided boards. It has excellent no-solder drip phenomena during the reflow process. ALPHA OM-535 with SBX02 alloy has been successfuly used with peak reflow profiles between 155 - 190℃. This version also shows a higher mechanical strength and drop shock resistance than SnBi0.4Ag alloy. The flux in ALPHA OM-535 has excellent electrical resistivity than exceeds industry standards. ALPHA OM-535 enables the elimination of an extra wave or selective wave soldering process when temperature sensitive through-hole components are used in an assembly. Product Key Features Increased daily throughput, eliminating the need for managing wave solder. Removes the need for an extra SMT process, which significantly lower the cost of producing an electronic assembly. The alloys yield very low voiding BGA solder joints, even when a traditional SAC alloy sphere is used. Applications Assembly of double-sided boards requiring a single reflow application. Applications demanding low-temperature soldering and reflow profiles between 155 - 190℃

### OM-535 Reflow Profile

### Application

- STENCIL: Recommend ALPHA CUT, ALPHA NICKEL-CUT, ALPHA TETRABOND&reg;, or ALPHA FORM stencils @ 0.100 mm - 0.150 mm (4-6 mil) thick for 0.4 - 0.5 mm (0.016&rdquo; or 0.020&rdquo;) pitch. Stencil design is subject to many process variables. Contact your local Alpha stencil site for advice.

- SQUEEGEE: Metal recommended

- PRESSURE: 0.21 - 0.36 kg/cm of blade (1.25 -2.0 Ibs/inch)

- SPEED: 25 &ndash; 100 mm per second (1 &ndash; 6 inches per second)

- PASTE ROLL: 1.5-2.0 cm diameter and make additions when roll reaches 1 cm (0.4&rdquo;) diameter (min). Max roll size will depend upon blade.

- STENCIL RELEASE SPEED: 1 &ndash; 5 mm/sec

- LIFT HEIGHT: 8 &ndash; 14 mm(0.31 &ndash; 0.55&rdquo;)
