shortDescription: LOCTITE® 315 is a blue, 1-part, self-shimming, thermally conductive, highly viscous, modified acrylic adhesive paste for bonding electrical components to heat sinks with an insulating gap. LOCTITE® 315 provides excellent heat dissipation while the controlled strength permits field and service repair. It produces a consistent 5 - 6 mm gap between the component and heat sink.This gap results in electrical insulation while maintaining thermal conductivity. Typical applications include bonding transformers, transistors and other heat generating electronic components to printed circuit board assemblies or heat sinks. In high pot applications this product should be limited to a maximum of 500 volts. Activator 7387™ is required for proper curing of Loctite® Output™ adhesives Cure Schedule Requires Activator 7387. 1h @ RT - 22°C and the adhesion increases with time.

### Thermal Cycle Resistance


Bonded aluminum to epoxyglass lap shears cured 72 hours @ 22 °C using Activator 7387™ on 1 side were subjected to thermal cycling of 15 °C to 100 °C with a ramp time of 30 minutes. No loss in strength occurred after 1000 hours of cycle time
