shortDescription: "LINQTAPE PET2S is a 2-mil polyester film backing with a pressure sensitive silicone adhesive system. PET2S polyester tape is a no/low residue tape designed for splicing and masking applications where high initial adhesion is required, but no residue once the tape is removed. LINQTAPE PET2S is a high performance, flexible, polyester tape used in a wide range of applications. For very high temperature applications, polyimide tape should be used, but for applications with temperatures up to 200C PET2S is the most effective and least expensive solution. PET2S-DCD polyester tape can be delivered in a range of die cut discs sizes with diameters ranging from 1/8\" to 12\". Key Features: No residue High initial adhesion For splicing and masking High performance Flexible"
