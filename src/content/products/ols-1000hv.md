shortDescription: OPTOLINQ OLS-1000HV is an optically clear spray-on halogen-free epoxy resin specifically designed for metal impregnation and LED lamps packaging applications. This halogen-free resin offers exceptional performance, combining good outgassing properties and extended service life at room temperature with rapid curing at medium temperatures. OPTOLINQ OLS-1000HV produces cured products with outstanding mechanical strength, excellent electrical performance, superior high-temperature resistance. OLS-1000HV boasts of its low internal stress performance during reflow soldering processes due to its optimized modulus. It is a reliable choice for high-quality through-hole packages requiring uniform high-light transmittance. OPTOLINQ-1000HV is available with infused visible light-blocking dyes with cutoff wavelengths at 700 nm, 750 nm, and 835 nm. See OCF blockers available for OPTILINQ Products.

### OPTOLINQ OLS-1000 Series | Visible Light Blocking Capabilities


OLS-1000LV and OLS-1000HV are developed with compatibility to various dyes with different onset transmittance as shown.




### OPTOLINQ OLS-1000HV | 2K Optically Clear Encapsulant


Optically clear encapsulation with excellent transparency and reflow performance.









Processing Instructions:



- Pre-heat Part A at 45~60°C for a maximum of 24 hours.

- Mix components A and B and stir uniformly.

- Defoam the mixture for 5 minutes.

Curing conditions (Determine according to the specific needs of the product, following conditions are for reference only.


- Cure at 130 - 145°C/1 - 1.5 hrs for encapsulation thickness less than 2mm.

- Cure at 125 - 130°C/4 - 5 hrs. for encapsulation thickness greater than 2mm.







Precautions:



- For optimal results, use the mixture within 6-8 hours after combining components A and B. Delaying application may lead to an undesirable increase in viscosity.

- Bake the molded package as soon as possible to prevent degradation by moisture.

- Pre-heating component A at 45~60°C can reduce viscosity, but excessively high temperatures will shorten the its pot life.

- Store the curing agent (component B) in sealed jars to prevent moisture absorption and sedimentation.

- When adding light diffusers, adjust the curing agent accordingly (e.g., A:B:Diffuser = 100:105:10).

- Preheat color additive agents at 60-90°C, ensuring complete dissolution.

- Avoid skin and eye contact. In case of contact, rinse thoroughly with soap (for skin) or clean water (for eyes), and seek medical attention if needed.

- Maintain a clean and ventilated workplace, using extraction trunks when necessary.

- Wear appropriate protective equipment and minimize direct contact with the human body. Refer to the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) before use.




Please note that the provided information is based on available data and typical conditions. For specific applications and detailed test results, refer to the actual test data and conduct appropriate certifications.


Storage and Handling


Store in a ventilated, dry, and clean environment below 25°C. Keep away from fire and heat sources. It is strictly forbidden to store in outdoor environments. At proper storage conditions, Part A has a shelf life of 6 months and Part B a shelf life of 3 months. Shelf life can be extended by using cold storage.
