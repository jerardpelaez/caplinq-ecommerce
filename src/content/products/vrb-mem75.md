sellingPoints:
  - Designed as cation (proton) exchange membranes for redox flow batteries
  - High acid capacity and conductivity for improved performance
  - Extended service life
shortDescription: "LINQCELL VRB-MEM75 is a 75 µm-thick perfluorinated cation exchange membrane produced through solution casting. This chemistry and manufacturing method provide several benefits, including high acid capacity and conductivity, enhanced crystallinity and tensile strength, reduced linear expansion and anisotropy, and an extended service life. These characteristics make LINQCELL VRB-MEM75 highly recommended for use as ion exchange membranes in redox flow batteries, particularly in all-vanadium flow batteries. Key Features: High Ionic Conductivity and Acid Capacity: High ionic conductivity and acid capacity enable efficient ion transport within the flow battery stack, supporting optimal electrochemical performance. When used in vanadium redox flow battery stacks, the Coulombic efficiency was as high as 96%. This value is not standard and will vary depending on the battery design, including factors such as electrode thickness and electrolyte concentration. Good Mechanical and Hydrolytic Properties: High tensile strength, low anisotropy, and minimal linear expansion upon conditioning ensure the membrane remains stable and durable under operational conditions. Long Service Life: With a service life >100,000 hours, LINQCELL VRB-MEM75 offers exceptional durability, reducing maintenance and replacement costs while improving reliability for continuous operation. Highly Recommended As: Ion exchange membranes of redox flow batteries LINQCELL VRB-MEM75 is part of the LINQCELL VRB-MEM Membrane Series, which offers two standard thicknesses: 50 µm (VRB-MEM50) and 75 µm (VRB-MEM75). These membranes can also be custom-fabricated to meet specific requirements, with a maximum roll width of 75 cm. Both VRB-MEM50 and VRB-MEM75 are supplied in the dry, acid (H+) form."
