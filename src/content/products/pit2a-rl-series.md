shortDescription: "LINQTAPE PIT2A-RL-Series Polyimide Tape is a high-temperature resistant polyimide tape on a 3mil PET Release Liner. It is designed for high temperature temporary bonding applications and it removes cleanly without adhesive residue after exposure to heat or chemicals. It may also be used in electrical insulation applications that require Class H Tape grade. Product Applications The 2-mil thickness makes it suitable for applications that require more mechanical strength and breakdown voltage than a standard (1-mil thick) polyimide film. Having an acrylic adhesive makes it suitable for higher temperature applications that cannot use silicone adhesives. Finally, being on a liner makes it suitable for applications that require the film to be die-cut. Applications: High Temperature Wafer Dicing Tape Die-cut polyimide parts PRODUCT FEATURES & BENEFITS: 2-mil polyimide thickness Acrylic Adhesive Linered"
