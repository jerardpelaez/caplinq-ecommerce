shortDescription: LINQCELL GDL2900 is a graphitized carbon plate, commonly used as a gas diffusion layer and electrode for fuel cells. Its through plane resistance is less than 25 mΩcm2. It has a thickess of 2.9mm that is measured at 50 kpa. LINQCELL GDL2900 has a density of ±0.60 g/cm3 and a through plane resistivity of 90mΩ-cm instead of 100mΩ-cm from the classic Spectracarb grades. Voltage loss is 28mV. Shortly, we should be able to die cut circles and most designs that you might require.
