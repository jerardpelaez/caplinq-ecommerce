shortDescription: "LINQCELL GDP280 is a 280-µm thick graphitized carbon fiber paper made from high-quality polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers. The fibers undergo a wet-laying process to form a non-woven, fibrous, and porous structure, which is then carbonized and graphitized. This high-temperature graphitization (1600 °C) results in high electrical conductivity, high oxidation resistance, and excellent thermal stability, making LINQCELL GDP280 highly recommended as gas diffusion layers in fuel cells. It can also be used as gas diffusion substrates for carbon dioxide electrolyzers. LINQCELL GDP280 has a microporous layer and PTFE coating, which provide hydrophobicity and increased surface area. The higher surface area maximizes catalyst utilization, which increases fuel cell efficiency. Meanwhile, the hydrophobic properties improve water removal and ensure stable operation by preventing flooding within the stack. Key Features: 280-µm Thickness: Optimized for reduced stack volume and internal resistance. High-Temperature Graphitization (1600 °C): Provides excellent electrical conductivity, oxidation resistance, and thermal stability. Microporous Layer & PTFE Coating: Enhances hydrophobicity, increases surface area, and optimizes catalyst utilization. Improved Water Management: Hydrophobic properties prevent flooding and ensure stable operation by enhancing water removal. Highly Recommended As: Gas diffusion layers of fuel cells, particularly proton exchange membrane fuel cells Gas diffusion substrates of carbon dioxide electrolyzer electrodes LINQCELL GDP280 performs best in fuel cell applications at temperatures between 60 and 80 °C and at low relative humidity levels (≤20%). Recommended For Fuel Cells Operating at: Low relative humidity (≥20%) at mid- to high temperatures (60–80 °C) Low relative humidity (>20%) at high temperatures ≥80 °C LINQCELL GDP280 is available in both sheet and roll forms. LINQCELL Graphitized Carbon Fiber Papers with MPL and PTFE treatment are offered in a standard width of 40 cm. Contact us for custom sizes or other specific requirements."
