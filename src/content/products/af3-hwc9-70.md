shortDescription: AEMION+™-AF3-HWC9-70 is a breakthrough advanced polyimidazolium-based ion exchange membrane that enables the rapid growth of the hydrogen economy. Ionomr's Aemion+® anion exchange membranes are significantly more durable than our competitors', leading to thinner membranes, longer service life and reduced overall system costs. AEMION+™ membranes have low ionic resistance and high electrical resistance. They are the first available commercial materials with excellent chemical stability in solutions of both high and low pH, and even in the harshest alkaline electrolysis systems (2–3M KOH, 80-100 °C). These advanced anion exchange membranes are frontiers in materials science with their unique hydrocarbon structure and good mechanical strength. All of these desirable properties unlock other potential applications that were previously constrained by the membrane’s poor durability and integrity. AEMION+™ is the enabling, platform material for the scale-up of AEMWE technology to industrial level. AEMION+™-AF3-HWC9-70 is the thinner version of AEMION+™ - AF3-HWK9-75. The thickness of ion exchange membranes plays a crucial role in the performance and efficiency of water electrolyzers and fuel cells. Generally, thinner membranes are often preferred to maximize conductivity and efficiency. Therefore, thin membranes are more suitable in applications where high power density and rapid response are more critical. On the other hand, thicker membranes are preferred or applications requiring long-term stability and robustness. Optimizing the membrane thickness to your specific electrochemical process and operating conditions is the key to unlocking optimal performance. With its excellent chemical stability at the full pH spectrum (0–14), AEMION+™-AF3-HWC9-70 can also be used in acid receovery and salt splitting applications. Aemion+® anion exchange membranes exhibit high oxidative tolerance, selectivity, and extended maintenance cycles, contributing to extended system lifetimes. AEMION+™-AF3-HWC9-70 demonstrates slightly lower proton blocking at high acid concentrations compared to other purpose-built AEMs. Still, it demonstrates significantly lower resistance and total power consumption per mole of acid, making them effective in concentrating applications (i.e., removal of total sulfate to 0 from a stream), and in use for acid concentration up to 5–7 wt%.

### AEMION+&reg; Enables Large-Scale Commercial Development of Water Electrolyzers

Alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) uses a liquid KOH/NaOH electrolyte between electrodes separated by a porous diaphragm. It benefits from low-cost catalysts but suffers from higher internal resistance and typically lower current densities.

Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) is compact and efficient due to high H+ conductivity, but the acidic environment drives reliance on PGM catalysts&mdash;raising CAPEX and OPEX.

This motivates a technology that blends AWE&rsquo;s inexpensive catalysts with PEMWE&rsquo;s compact zero-gap design: alkaline anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE/AAEMWE). Using an anion exchange membrane enables low-cost catalysts while maintaining a compact architecture. At current scales, AWE and PEMWE CAPEX exceed DOE targets; AEMWE offers a pathway to lower CAPEX and competitive green hydrogen. Developing high-performance, stable AEMs is central to this transition.

At 1 MW, AWE ($1279/kW) and PEMWE ($1168/kW) are similar, while AEMWE with AEMION+&reg; is lower at $931/kW and $926/kW (without/with PGM). At 5 MW, all costs drop but AEMWE remains lowest ($444&ndash;459/kW). The pathway to low-cost, sustainable electrolysis is enabled by continued AEMWE advances.

# AEMION+&reg; Reinforced Membranes Pre-treatment Guide

Membranes ship dry in chloride/iodide form. Depending on application, assembly may be done in the dry form or after pre-treatment. Exchange to the operating ionic form while assembled, as required by your device chemistry. The following protocol outlines the recommended activation and handling steps for water electrolysis applications. Adjust electrolyte volume, temperature, and duration as necessary for your system scale and QA criteria.

### Recommended Activation & Handling Steps before use in Water Electrolysis

STEP 1

### Activation 1 &mdash; Iodide/Chloride &rarr; Nitrate Form Exchange

Depending on the assembly method, perform the iodide/chloride-to-nitrate exchange either ex situ (wet) or in situ (dry) using one of the protocols below.

**Safety:** Handle KOH with appropriate PPE. Dispose of nitrate/KOH effluent per local regulations.

STEP 3

### Check conversion & electrical readiness

Verify ionic form by XRF/EDS or similar analytical method. Beginning-of-life HFR should be &le; 200 m&Omega;&middot;cm&sup2;.

**Caution:** Never contact the AEM with DI water after the KOH exchange, including dip/rinse.

STEP 4

### Mounting

Prefer mounting wet to avoid differential stresses from drying.

Tip: Align reinforcement warp/weft consistently across cells to minimize in-plane curl and assembly variation.

### Recommended Activation & Handling Steps before use in Fuel Cells

FUEL CELL

For AEM fuel cell applications use the following general pre-treatment approach:

- Soak for at least 24 hours, and up to 36&ndash;48 hours is recommended.

- Exchange into KOH first may aid subsequent exchanges (e.g., sulfate).

Note: Verify ionic form by XRF/EDS (or similar) prior to MEA assembly. Align reinforcement orientation consistently across cells.

### Spray-Coating Catalyst Layers onto AEMION+ Membranes (CCM Preparation)

Optimized process for spray-coating catalyst layers directly onto ion-exchange membranes (e.g., Aemion⁺) using a Sono-Tek ExactaCoat or similar system

Quick overview (click to expand)

- Preheat to ~70 &deg;C, fix membrane flat, avoid air gaps.

- Ink flow &le; 0.8 mL min⁻&sup1;; head speed &le; 75 mm min⁻&sup1;.

- Multiple light passes; rotate 90&deg; periodically; repeat for second side.

- Dry gently; avoid excessive heat or strong airflow.

STEP 1

### Preparation

Preheat to ~70 &deg;C. Fix membrane flat with small (heat-resistant) tape at corners.

- Use a porous heat-transfer layer to avoid air gaps.

- 0.5 cm uncoated border; &ge; 2 cm mask overlap.

- Mild tension or a template frame to prevent curl.

STEP 2

### Ink Loading

Load &asymp; 25 mL ink, purge air, and use toggle to verify steady flow and a consistent spray pattern.

STEP 3

### Coating and Feed / Flow Rate

- Flow: &le; 0.8 mL min&minus;1

- Head speed: &le; 75 mm min&minus;1

- Keep surface at ~70 &deg;C throughout.

- Prefer multiple light passes to avoid pooling.

Tip: Begin with low flow; tune shaping air & traverse until a fine, even mist is achieved.

STEP 4

### Layer Uniformity

- Pause every 1&ndash;2 runs for visual inspection.

- Adjust flow/pattern if unevenness appears.

- Rotate the membrane 90&deg; every 5&ndash;10 runs.

- Repeat to target loading.

STEP 5

### Coating the Second Side

After reaching target loading, flip, re-mask, align with the first side, and repeat with the same parameters.

STEP 6

### Post-Coating Drying

Dry gently until touch-dry. With high-boiling solvents, extend time slightly; avoid excessive heat or strong airflow that can deform the CCM.

### Notes & Cautions

- Do not exceed 0.8 mL min&minus;1 flow or 75 mm min&minus;1 head speed.

- Use templates/support frames during ion-exchange and coating to minimize curling.

- Pooling or streaks mean over-deposition &rarr; reduce flow or passes.

- Membranes must be clean and lightly hydrated but free of surface moisture before coating.

# Removal of the Membrane from the Backing Layer

PRIMARY METHOD

- With clean gloved hands, hold the membrane on its backing layer.

- Using a thumb or finger, rub against the corner edge of the membrane to produce separation from the backing layer.

- Once corner separation is achieved, carefully and gently pull the membrane from the backing while holding the backer on a clean, dry surface.

- Support the membrane as you peel until it has been fully removed.

SECONDARY METHOD

- With clean gloves, wet a portion of the membrane/backing edge with de-ionized water to aid separation. Repeat the primary method.

- If separation does not start, spritz a small amount of water near the edge and try again.

#### For coating AEMION&reg; membranes after removing from the backing layer

Ensure that the membrane remains flat.

A powder-coating masking tape can be used to overlap the membrane edges prior to coating to stabilize the membrane and minimize stress lines.

Use caution when removing tape after coating, as tears may occur. Cutting off the taped section is an alternative.

Use caution to remove tape from the membrane after the coating process.

#### Roll unwind orientation (base film facing out)
