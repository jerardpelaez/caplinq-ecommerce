shortDescription: OPTOLINQ BMC-4200 is a Series of Opaque molding compounds used as encapsultation of optoelectronic devices. It exhibits excellent moldability under suitable spiral flow conditions. This material exhibits excellent thermal stability, meaning it can withstand high temperatures without significant degradation. Additionally, it possesses outstanding mechanical processing performance, making it easily moldable and shapeable during manufacturing. The material's remarkable moldability allows for precise and intricate molding of optoelectronic devices, ensuring consistent and high-quality production. Furthermore, its superior reliability ensures that the molded devices maintain their performance and functionality over extended periods, making it a highly dependable choice for optoelectronic applications. Molding information OPTOLINQ BMC-4200 differs from other molding compounds and has some special procedures required. Temperature recovery OPTOLINQ BMC-4200 must first be allowed to achieve room temperature (20±5°C , 40±15% RH) for atleast 24 hours (Big size) and 12 hours (Small size), without opening the bag before using it, to avoid contamination. Preheat Preheating of OPTOLINQ BMC-4200 can be done by using standard RF equipment. The preheating should be done slowly to achieve uniform temperature.
