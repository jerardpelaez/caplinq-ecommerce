shortDescription: PEM-665 (R9990) is a methacrylate terminated polyester oligomer that has low color and low cure shrinkage. The backbone of this product consists of a statistical distribution of low molecular weight polyester segments. A representative structure is shown above. The cycloaliphatic dibasic ester residues as well as the methacrylate end-groups resist hydrolysis. This oligomer has approximately 33% less cure shrinkage than BisGMA at 100% conversion. Unlike BisGMA, it is not based upon a bisphenol A backbone and therefore does not have the potential to act as an endocrine disruptor. PEM-665 (R9990) is recommended for use as a base resin in dental applications. R9990 also has good solubility in both aliphatic and aromatic co-monomers.
