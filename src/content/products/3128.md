shortDescription: "LOCTITE 3128 is a one part, heat curable epoxy designed to cure at low temperature and gives excellent adhesion on a wide range of materials in considerably short time. Typical applications include Memory cards, CCD/CMOS Assemblies and Lid/Cap attach for automotive optical sensors and 3d sensing modules. LOCTITE 3128 can be successfully used as an Edgebond underfill, particularly suited where low curing temperatures are required for heat sensitive components. This low halogen, high viscosity, heat curable epoxy has a good adhesion to a variety of surfaces and a whopping 3 weeks of pot life. LOCTITE 3128 has a fairly low CTE and warpage and as such has also been used on finger print sensor encapsulation with positive results. This is a camera/sensor market material so is not expected to pass very harsh reliability requirements. Recommended cure schedule 20 minutes @ 80°C bondline temperature 60 minutes @ 60 °C bondline temperature Note: Sufficient time must be added to allow the bond location to reach the desired cure temperature. Curing profiles should be developed for each device."
