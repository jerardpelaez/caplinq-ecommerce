shortDescription: LINQTAPE™ DCT-PVC95 is a polymerized vinyl chloride tape used in the dicing process. It provides an excellent balance of electrical, mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties. Its strong adhesion ensures the wafer remains secure during different manufacturing processes like die-cutting. The security the tape provides prevents wafer damage, whiskers, soaking and allows for cleaner cuts. LINQTAPE™ DCT-PVC95 can be peeled by using UV. To ensure a clean substrate after removing the tape, DCT-PVC95 utilizes a technology through which after applying UV light, the adhesive (3,200 N/25mm) becomes less tacky (140 N/25mm), which facilitates the removal of the tape. This quality makes the tape ideal for glass, sensitive substrates, and applications for which the final product must be clean of any residue. DCT-PVC95 is a translucent 80µm film, with a one-sided 15µm acrylic adhesive layer, and backed with a PET liner. It is ideal for small chips. Key Features Strong adhesion to prevent wafer damage UV removable adhesive No residue Can be used with uneven surfaces Antistatic High Transparency High and evenly distributed elasticity High heat tolerance (60 °C for a few minutes) Application Ideas Die -cutting Glass and sensitive applications
