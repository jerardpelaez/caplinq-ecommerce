shortDescription: "Hysol GR30 is a halogen-free, black, semiconductor-grade epoxy molding compound or duroplast designed for the encapsulation and protection of TO220 and TO247 power devices. Once molded and post-mold cured, this product provides optimium protection and reliability for these semiconductor devices. It is a more productive version of GR300 with a CTI of 600V. While GR300 is a great product for TO220 and TO247 it is not as productive as other EMC products. The number of shots that can be done is less than some other EMC and depending on the age of the mold, the GR300 can sometimes stick in the mold making it more difficult to get the parts out. Furthermore, GR300 was designed to be used in multi-gang pot (MGP) molds and conventional molds where the cure time does not need to be fast. GR30 has a shorter gel time, giving it a faster cycle time for automold equipment. Hysol GR30 was formulated to have better electrical properties then its predecessor. This means that the GR30 passes higher levels of high-temperature reverse bias (HTRB) than the standard GR300 and offers excellent HTRB performance. Additionally, it is an environmentally \"Green\" product, meaning that it doesn't contain any bromine, antimony or phosphorus flame retardants. Previous MG-series EMC dominated the space for power semiconductors but used halogen-containing flame retardants. This next generation epoxy mold compound replaces these older generation products. It is designed to achieve JEDEC Level 1 requirements at 260°C reflow temperature on Nickel or Nickel-plated leadframes. And to top that up, it meets UL 94 V-0 Flammability at 1/8 inch (3.18mm) thickness. This product is an alternative that can easily replace the discontinued Kyocera KE-G300S. Available Versions: GR350HT (High Thermal Conductivity of 1.95 W/mK) Key Features Low thermal stress and excellent electrical stability. Excellent reliability performance on TC, PCT, etc. Meet with all type devices especially MOSFET, Schottky, etc. Good delam performance after stress test Good adhesion performance Excellent workability - 500 shots continuous molding Suitable for Conventional/MGP/Auto Mold type Green material without Br/Sb in compliance with ROHS. Meet UL94 V-0 flammability rate at 1/8 inch thickness. Key Features for Rotor Magnet Fixing Good filling ability for gap around magnets in rotor. Good binding force for rotor and magnet. Excellent reliability performance at working temperature. Fast cure for high effective units per hour."

Designed for TO220 & TO247 devices

TO220 and TO247 are big, bulky packages, so molding these products with a standard mold compound is fairly easy without using any fine fillers. The trouble with these packages however is that epoxy mold compounds used typically fail Hig Temperature Reverse Bias (HTRB) testing, which exposes the device to humidity and temperature while the device is under BIAS. Devices often experience "gate leakage" under these conditions and fail catastrophically.

Furthermore, these devices are often used using a Nickel (Ni) plated Cu leadframe, which is very difficult to adhere to. Customer reliability testing on TO3P, TO220, and TO252 packages using GR30 has demonstrated excellent adhesion of the EMC to Nickel (Ni) plated Cu leadframe, with minimal to zero delamination observed after testing. Specifically, GR30 utilized in TO220 packages exhibited no delamination after TCT500 (-65&deg;C to 150&deg;C) and PCT96 tests. For GR30 in TO252 packages, only non-critical delamination was observed after the same TCT500 (-65&deg;C to 150&deg;C) and PCT96 tests. GR30-ON for Automotive TO247/TO220

Note: 1. LSR* stands for low stress resin with self extinguish property; 2. GR30-ON is commerical product for TO247/TO220 automotive application; 3. Property data are typical value for reference only, not to be used as quality guarantee GR30 and GR30-ON are high-performance EOCN-based epoxy molding compounds with optimized filler loading, UL94 V-0 flammability, and a balanced set of mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties for reliable encapsulation. GR30 is well suited for applications that prioritize high Tg and stiffness, while GR30-ON, with its higher spiral flow and lower CTE, is ideal for more complex or stress-sensitive package designs allowing customers to select the grade that best matches their device, process, and reliability requirements.

GR30 Thermal Degradation Performance

In an inert atmosphere, Hysol GR30 shows a single dominant degradation event with negligible mass change up to ~300&ndash;350 &deg;C, indicating low volatile content and good bake stability. By the extrapolated-tangent method, **T₅% = 406 &deg;C** and **T₁₀% = 434 &deg;C**. The DTG trace peaks at **Tmax = 430 &deg;C** with a maximum rate of **0.00385 %/&deg;C**, marking the principal scission of the organic network. Residue at 800 &deg;C is high (**char = 82.41 %**) with **total mass loss = 17.59 %**, consistent with a highly filled epoxy system that carbonizes in N₂. Practically, **this profile implies minimal outgassing or weight loss through standard package exposures** (post-mold cure 170&ndash;190 &deg;C, assembly peaks &le;260 &deg;C), and strong retention of integrity under short, high-temperature excursions below ~400 &deg;C.

In a mixed oxidizing atmosphere, the main event shifts and broadens: **T₅% = 424 &deg;C**, **T₁₀% = 466 &deg;C**, and the DTG maximum moves to **Tmax = 458 &deg;C** with a lower peak rate (**0.0028 %/&deg;C**). The higher Tmax coupled with a reduced final residue (**ash = 78.11 % at 800 &deg;C**, **total mass loss = 21.89 %**) reflects early-stage oxidative stabilization (which can delay the peak rate temperature) followed by oxidation of carbonaceous char at higher temperatures, increasing overall mass loss versus N₂. The tailing DTG in the 450&ndash;600 &deg;C region captures progressive char burn-off typical for epoxy systems exposed to oxygen.

GR30 has been successfully used for Magnet Fixing in Electric Vehicle Rotors Epoxy molding compound is used to bond the magnet and rotor core by using a transfer molding method. There are several slots that go through the core. The permanent magnets are inserted in the slot and then the mold compound is filled into the gap to bind the magnet and the rotor core together. The critical function of the material is to have a strong binding force between the magnet and the rotor core while also having a good filling capability. It should also have excellent reliability at working temperature. GR30 is a green material without Br/Sb, in compliance with ROHS that can cure fast for high Units per Hour. Molding compounds have already been used in Rotors with Iron as a base material and with rotor working speeds up to 20000rpm and working temperatures up to &plusmn;150&deg;C. They pass both Temperature cycling and High temperature ATF resistance tests while retaining 100% of their flexural strength and flexural modulus. This highlights the product's excellent property stability post post-automotive fluid resistance testing.
