shortDescription: LINQCELL GDL1850 is a graphitized carbon plate, commonly used as a gas diffusion layer and electrode for fuel cells. Its through plane resistance is less than 13.3 mΩcm2. The thickness is 1.85mm and is measured at 50 kpa. The plate is using a phenolic resin and the (full carbon) final product contains ~40% resin carbon and ~60% carbon fiber's carbon. LINQCELL GDL1850 has a density of ±0.85 g/cm3 and a through plane resistivity of 70mΩ-cm instead of 100mΩ-cm from the classic Spectracarb grades. Voltage loss is 25mV. This product is a close alternative to Spectracarb 2050A-7590.

Are there Zn traces in Carbon papers?


While not specific to GDL1850, testing on a similar carbon paper (with MPL) with reference to USEPA 3052, with an MDL of 0.0010% during that test, showed a concentration of 0.000627 wt% of Zinc. So we don't expect to find any traces in GDL1850 either.
