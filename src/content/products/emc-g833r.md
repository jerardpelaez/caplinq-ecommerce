shortDescription: "LINQSOL™ EMC-G833R is a black, halogen-free (“green”) epoxy molding compound engineered for QFN, QFP, and other SMD packages. A long gel time (~52 s @ 175 °C) pairs with high spiral flow (~150 cm @ 175 °C) to deliver a generous processing window—ideal for thin runners, complex gate designs, and high-cavity tools typical of QFN/QFP molding. The compound’s low moisture uptake (~0.28% PCT-24 h) and very low ionic extractables (Cl⁻/Na⁺ ≈ 5 ppm) support MSL 1 capability, while UL-94 V-0 helps meet safety and compliance needs. With a low CTE (α1 ≈ 10 ppm/°C, α2 ≈ 36 ppm/°C), low mold shrinkage (~0.15%), and balanced mechanicals (≈162 MPa flexural strength; ≈24 GPa modulus at 25 °C), EMC-G833R maintains dimensional control and package reliability through assembly and reflow. Recommended molding parameters (170–180 °C; 8–25 s transfer; 100–180 s cure @ 175 °C; post-mold cure 4–8 h @ 175 °C) fit standard transfer molding lines. Formulated RoHS & REACH compliant, EMC-G833R brings a dependable blend of throughput, yield, and long-term performance. EMC-G833R guarantees excellent performance and outstanding reliability. This product is deliberately formulated without the inclusion of substances prohibited by the European Union RoHS and REACH. Overall, LINQSOL EMC-G833R seamlessly integrates advanced material properties, safety compliance, and superior performance to deliver a reliable solution for semiconductor device encapsulation. Key Features High spiral flow (~150 cm @ 175 °C) — Fills fine-pitch and thin-gate QFN/QFP tools cleanly to reduce short-shots and voids. Long gel time (~52 s @ 175 °C) — Wide process latitude for complex runners and multi-cavity molds; easier parameter tuning. MSL 1 capable — Supports robust board-level reliability and simplified dry-pack handling. Ultra-low moisture & ions — ~0.28% (PCT-24 h) and Cl⁻/Na⁺ ≈ 5 ppm each help minimize popcorn, CAF, and leakage risk. Low CTE & shrinkage — α1 ≈ 10 ppm/°C, α2 ≈ 36 ppm/°C, shrinkage ~0.15% for coplanarity and warpage control. UL-94 V-0 — Meets stringent flammability requirements for safety-critical designs. Halogen-free (“Green”) — RoHS & REACH compliant formulation for global compliance. Application Suitable for QFN families: QFN, DFN, MLF, QFNs with exposed pad / thermal slug QFP families: LQFP, TQFP, PQFP, thin-pack QFP variants Other SMD packages: SOP/SSOP/TSSOP/MSOP, small discretes requiring high flow and low warpage Use cases: High-cavity, fine-pitch transfer molding; assemblies needing MSL 1, low warpage, and UL-94 V-0 compliance"
