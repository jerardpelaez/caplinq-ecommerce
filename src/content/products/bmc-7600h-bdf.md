  - Fine pitch RGB
  - Black with wet method
shortDescription: OPTOLINQ BMC-7600H-BDF is a high-performance, black coloured, optically clear epoxy developed for small space RGB applications. This single component epoxy exhibits excellent adhesion and stability at high temperature that helps achieve great package performance and long life. It works very similar, if not better than XX600H product types. BMC-7600H-BDF gets its black colour not by powder mixing but with a wet method . This low stress, led encapsulation epoxy passes TCT, PCT and moisture reliability testing on EMC1010 package standard. It is a reliable product that passes reflow thermal cycling test at 85°C @85% relative humidity and is ideal for fine pitch RGB.
