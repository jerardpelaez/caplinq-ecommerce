shortDescription: "LINQSOL BCP-1509 is a Reddish brown, busbar epoxy coating powder. It aims at medium to high voltage busbar applications. It performs uniform and smooth coating results from 0.3mm to 3mm. It is especially suitable for large busbar applications used for power distribution. With optimized gel time and flow, it allows large busbars with high heat capacity dip multiple times in fluidized bed to build thickness as high as 3mm without dripping and sag. BCP-1509 meets the UL 746B Relative Thermal Index (RTI) of 105&deg;C and CTI 600V. For small busbar applications, we recommend BCP-1507 with powder quick build rate. Features: Aims at medium to high voltage application Comparable with DK19 Good adhesion to copper, alumina Thick and no-sag coating performance Both electrostatic spray and fluidized bed coating Recommended coating Temperature: 180 &ndash; 230 &deg;C. (200 &deg;C x 30 min)"

OBSERVATION

- Coating appearance: Smooth, no-sag, no-dripping, great edge coverage

- Coating process: Quick build rate on thickness

- Suitable thickness: both thin and thick thickness (>1mm)

DISCUSSION

BCP-1509 presents excellent coating performance. BCP-1509 is developed based on BCP-1507 with slightly lower flowability while melting, thus has less chance to drip or sag with multiple dipping times. It is designed to coat more than 3mm on large size busbars or copper busbars.

## BCP-1509 Powder In Fluidized Bed

### Storage

Store in a ventilated, dry, and clean environment below 25&deg;C. Keep away from fire and heat sources. It is strictly forbidden to store in outdoor environments. At proper storage conditions, the product has a shelf life of 6 months.

### Precautions

- Avoid long-term skin contact. Powder that touched the skin should be rinsed off quickly.

- During operation dust-proof masks should be used to avoid inhalation.

- Keep the oven temperature stable, so as not to affect the colour and quality of the coating due to excessive temperature deviation.

- The concentration of dust should be controlled within a safe range to avoid malfunction of the coating equipment.
