shortDescription: "LINQTAPE HDT1SR is an advanced solution for the visual detection of hydrogen gas leaks. This tape undergoes a rapid color change – transitioning from beige to black or beige to blue (depending on variant) in as little as 10 seconds when exposed to hydrogen gas. The speed of this color transformation is contingent on factors like flow rate, temperature, time, and hydrogen percentage. LINQTAPE HDT1SR provides an effective means of detecting gas leaks, significantly improving response time by facilitating the identification of intermittent leaks. Its high sensitivity allows it to detect hydrogen leaks with concentrations as low as 1% H2, making it a reliable safety net in various applications. LINQTAPE HDT1SR offers two distinct options for indicating exposure to hydrogen gas: permanent and reversible. The permanent variant undergoes a lasting color change to black upon exposure, providing a reliable, enduring indication of contact. On the other hand, the reversible variant shifts to a blue hue in the presence of hydrogen gas, returning to its original color once removed from exposure. Applying this tape is effortless, employing a user-friendly silicone/polyimide PSA (Pressure Sensitive Adhesive) that ensures a seamless process.\" LINQTAPE HDT1SR can be used in a variety of indoor or outdoor environments. It outperforms conventional portable or stationary sensors, offering superior detection and precise identification of hydrogen leak locations. This tape is less influenced by external factors such as wind, position, duration, or user skills. It provides comprehensive visibility, allowing for easy inspection of vertical and bottom faces. Key Features: Reliable hydrogen gas detection Can detect concentrations as low as 1% Color changing for ease of use Countless applications"

How should we apply the tape at joints or critical locations?


The surface must be clear of oil, powder, foreign matters or release agents.



- Begin and finish wrapping at least 5cm away from the joint or critical location to ensure coverage extends beyond the potential leak point.

- Hold the tape at a slight angle and start wrapping around the pipe, overlapping each layer by half the tape width.

- Maintain consistent tension to avoid wrinkles and air pockets

- Secure the end of the tape by pressing it firmly against the wrapped area

- Periodically inspect the tape-wrapped areas during routine maintenance to ensure the wrapping remains intact and effective.

- If any part of the tape wrapping becomes damaged or compromised, re-wrap the affected areas following the same procedure






Applications:





Power and chemical plants.




Transportation markets.




Hydrogen Co-Generators.




Fuel stations.




Storage tanks and compressors.




New energy markets and more.







Application Ideas:





Easily applied to or wrapped around pipes, flanges, fittings, valves, access panels, etc., providing immediate identification of precise hydrogen leak locations.




Permanent Color Indication: Identifies leak locations even if the hydrogen line is shut off.





What happens if these tapes are exposed to higher temperatures? LINQTAPE HDT1SR is a Polyimide tape with a Silicone adhesive that is reactive to Hydrogen. When it comes to materials, this is very similar to our PIT1S so the operating temperature is 260°C. The problem lies with the reactive nature of the tape. The higher the temperature, the lower the time it takes to detect H2. Since some Hydrogen applications are in the negative °C, we know that it will take much, much longer for the tape to react at cryo temperatures.


On the upper limit, we have tested it for 6 months at 60°C and it works fine. We don't know how the tape would react in higher temperatures though. Technically, the materials should be OK but the high temp will probably affect the reactivity and cause all kinds of issues. The entire idea with H2 detection tapes is really to prevent things such as jet fire from happening by regular monitoring. In theory, we expect the tape to react since H2 will be present and the temperature caused by the jet fire will accelerate the reaction. In practice, we don't know.


it is important to note that the tape WILL react even with a very low % of H2 in the air (even 1% will suffice). It will just take much longer (hours) than if there were higher concentrations where you would expect a color change within a couple of minutes.


Can I remove and reuse the reversible tapes?


If there is no damage to the tape when removed, it can be re-applied it onto the pipeline. However, due to the tape's tendency to fuse, it may be difficult to remove it intact. Although there is no exact data, the color will continue to change as long as it is not subject to harsh environmental conditions.




How long does the tape take to reverse back to beige?


The tape will only revert back to its original color after no hydrogen is present.
