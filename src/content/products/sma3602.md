shortDescription: LINQBOND SMA3602 is a one-component epoxy developed for chip bonding. This product offers medium viscosity, high thixotropy, and fast curing at low temperatures. It is suitable for screen printing and dispensing applications. The product forms strong cured shapes without stringing or slumping, even at high-speed dispensing and with very small dots. The hardened surface of this product does not exhibit surface oiliness. Once cured, LINQBOND SMA3602 offers excellent adhesive strength, electrical insulation properties, and superior chemical and solvent resistance. Stable adhesive strength can be achieved with various SMT (Surface-Mount Technology) applications. This product is well-suited for electronic device encapsulation and chip bonding.
