Storage


Store product in the unopened container in a dry location. Storage information may be indicated on the product container labeling.


Optimal Storage: 5°C or below, in closed containers. After removal from cold storage, the material MUST be allowed to come to room temperature, in the sealed container, to avoid moisture contamination. The suggested waiting time for a standard 15 kg carton box is 24 hours.
