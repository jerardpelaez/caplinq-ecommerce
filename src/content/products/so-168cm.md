shortDescription: "LINQBOND SO-168CM is a organotin and dibutyltin (DBT) compound-free, moisture-curing, modified silicone adhesive, engineered to comply with stringent EU regulations. This advanced formulation utilizes alkoxy functional groups to facilitate ambient temperature curing via atmospheric moisture. SO-168CM has rapid curing profile and odorless features. This adhesive exhibits superior cohesive and adhesive strength compared to conventional silicone-based counterparts, making it optimally suited for demanding critical casting and bonding applications within the 3C (Computers, Communications, and Consumer Electronics) industry. Product Key Features: Moisture-Curing Mechanism: Cures via reaction with ambient humidity without the need for external heat or activators. Fast Curing Speed: Makes production throughput more efficient and reduces cycle times. Enhanced Adhesion Strength: Provides robust and reliable bonding for critical applications. Optimized for 3C Industry: Specifically designed to meet the performance demands of electronics and consumer goods manufacturing. Applications Critical casting Structural bonding in electornics"

Directions for Use



- Apply to a clean surface which should be free of dirt, grease or mold release. In many cases, a simple solvent wipe is sufficient.

- Pour or brush this product onto the substrates. It is not recommend to stir it onto the substrates to avoid formation of air bubbles. This product will be cured through air-drying but propeties depend on its thickness, curing temperatrue, and relative humidity.

- When casting in thicker components or devices, the resin might not be cured thoroughly at the bottom of the components or devices because the bottom resin is difficult to cure with the moisture. It is recommended to extend the cure time, so that the moisutre can be diffused from the top to the bottom. Another solution is to cast the components or devices twice. Cast the resin to half height of components and devices first. When the surface is almost dry and tacky, cast the resin for a second time.

- Use this product as soon as possible after opening the original package. When not in use, please replace the lid tightly and store in a cool and dry place.

- Cure time depends on part geometry, materials to be bonded, bondline thickness, and humidity. Cure schedule should be in accordance with actual specifications of production parts and equipment.

- Cured product is safe for human skin contact.
