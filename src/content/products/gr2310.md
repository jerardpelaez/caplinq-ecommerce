shortDescription: Hysol GR2310 is a Gold semiconductor epoxy molding compound or duroplast designed for the encapsulation and protection of Manganese Oxide (MnO2) tantalum capacitors and automotive sensor packages. Once molded and post-mold cured, this product provides optimium protection and reliability for these capacitor devices. Hysol GR2310 is a laser markable product, designed for the new generation of capacitors. Tantalum capacitors are general purpose chip tantalum capacitors which are mature products and as such must be cost-competitive. Although the GR2310 has "only" been manufactured for 15 years or so, they are based on their halogen-containing counterparts and though these products do not contain halogens, the manufacturing process has been optimised a long time ago so as to offer the lowest cost possible. Hysol GR2310 is an environmentally "green" product, meaning that doesn't contain any halogens including bromine, antimony or phosphorus flame retardants. MG33F-0520, MG33F-0588 and MG33F-0602 dominated the space for tantalum capacitors but used halogen-containing flame retardants. This next generation epoxy mold compound replaces these older generation products.This material is designed to achieve JEDEC Level 1 requirements at 260°C reflow temperature on Maganese Oxide MnO2 capacitors. Its fast cure time also ensures that it is compatible with the latest automold manufacturing equipment. Hysol GR2310 meets UL 94 V-0 Flammability at 1/4 inch (6.35mm) thickness.
