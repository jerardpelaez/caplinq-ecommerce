shortDescription: Hysol MG33F-0520 is a first generation gold epoxy molding compound that is specifically designed for use in high volume molding of tantalum capacitors. It is a silica filled, environmentally friendly 'green' molding compound with high thermal cycling stability, low stain and low moisture absorption. It has been successfully used for surface mount Mno2 tantalum capacitors and reed relays. Its solvent resistance makes it suitable for use with automotive fluids such as mineral spirits and ethylene glycol. Hysol MG33F-0520 has excellent moldability and fast cycle times while also offering lasermark capabilities. It has low levels of ionic contaminants, excellent adhesion to copper and is stable after multiple thermal cycles. The main difference from MG33 is that it contains a flame retardant (F) which allows it to meet the UL94 V-0 flammability rating. Curing Time 30 to 45 seconds @170°C 1.0 to 1.5 minutes @150°C Post Cure 2 hours @150°C

### This product claims low moisture absorption. Can it withstand X parameters for Y years?


MG33F-0520 water absorption test is 0.6% by weight (Pressure Cooker Test for 24 hours @ 121°C). This data cannot be translated into product lifetime as there are still many variables to determine the life of the device (experimental and computational modeling). What we actually need is a test during qual on HAST and/or Autoclave. Customers have different ways of extrapolating and predicting the lifetime of the device.


There are many moisture-related failure modes and several tests can be conducted to determine the likelihood of a failure mode occurring. Ultimately, Molding compounds, any of them, are semi-permeable materials that are always susceptible to moisture. It will highly depend on storage conditions, handling, equipment packaging etc.


Filler loading and resin type, can also help understand the molding compound's ability to absorb or resist moisture. A filer with more than 70% is resistant to moisture. This is one approach to make the material moisture-resistant. MG33F-0520 has 74%. On the other hand the best resin to resist moisture is Biphenyl based. MG33F-0520 is not that. The resin system is EOCN (O-Cresol Novolac Epoxy Resin)+PN.


Based on this information we assume an MSL3 level will be hard to attain. We recommend baking the molded device at 125C for 2 hours. This removes moisture and provides confidence to the package's lifetime.
