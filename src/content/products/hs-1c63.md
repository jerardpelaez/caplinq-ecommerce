## Frequently Asked Questions About HumiSeal® 1C63



### What are typical applications for HumiSeal® 1C63?


HumiSeal® 1C63 is a UV/RTV curing, oxime-type cure silicone conformal coating used for protecting printed circuit board assemblies (PCBs) in various industries, including:



- Aerospace systems (e.g., avionics, control modules)

- Automotive electronics (e.g., engine control units, sensors)

- Industrial automation (e.g., motor drives, PLCs)

- Consumer electronics (e.g., smartphones, gaming devices)






### Why choose HumiSeal® 1C63 over other conformal coatings?


HumiSeal® 1C63 is a non-corrosive, single-component coating that cures with both UV light and atmospheric moisture, providing a fast, tack-free surface and excellent protection in hard-to-reach areas. It provides excellent electrical insulation, fluoresces under UV for easy inspection, and is easily reworkable. It is also recognized under UL File Number E105698 and is RoHS Directive 2011/65/EC compliant, making it a trusted choice for demanding applications. You can learn how to select a conformal coating in our blog.






### What is the shelf life of HumiSeal® 1C63?


HumiSeal® 1C63 has a shelf life of 6 months from the date of manufacture when stored at or below 27°C in tightly closed containers. Prior to use, allow the product to equilibrate for 24 hours at room temperature to ensure optimal performance. The product also has a long pot life, typically exceeding 30 days.




### How should I clean tools after applying HumiSeal® 1C63?


Tools and equipment used for applying HumiSeal® 1C63 can be cleaned with a suitable solvent, such as a mineral spirit or acetone, before the coating cures. Thinner is not required or recommended for this product. Always use a lint-free cloth and ensure proper ventilation during cleaning. The recommended stripper for this product is Humiseal Stripper 1090.






### What happens to HumiSeal® 1C63 after its shelf life?


Past its 6-month shelf life, HumiSeal® 1C63 may experience changes in viscosity, which could affect application consistency and coating uniformity. Using expired product may lead to suboptimal performance, and the manufacturer will not be liable for quality or performance issues if expired material is used. If the product has cured in the container, it cannot be recovered.




### Why do curing times vary for HumiSeal® 1C63?


HumiSeal® 1C63 is a dual-curing coating. Its tack-free surface is achieved in seconds under UV light, while a secondary moisture cure ensures that shadowed or unexposed areas fully cure within 24 hours at ambient temperature and 50% relative humidity. This dual-cure mechanism makes it suitable for high-volume production while ensuring complete protection.






### What is the recommended thickness for HumiSeal® 1C63?


The recommended coating thickness for HumiSeal® 1C63 is 50 to 200 microns. This range ensures optimal protection without compromising flexibility or electrical performance. The thickness is controlled primarily by the application method and withdrawal rate, as the coating is not designed to be thinned.




### What are the differences between application methods for HumiSeal® 1C63?


HumiSeal® 1C63 can be applied via spraying, dipping, or brushing. Spraying and dipping are ideal for large-scale production, while brushing is suited for small repairs. This product has a low viscosity and does not require thinning for any of these methods. Each method should be controlled to achieve a uniform coating, especially the withdrawal rate for dipping, which should be between 5–15 cm/min.






### What is the maximum operating temperature for HumiSeal® 1C63?


HumiSeal® 1C63 can withstand a wide thermal range, making it suitable for high-temperature applications where its protective properties must be maintained under constant thermal stress.




### What safety precautions should I take when using HumiSeal® 1C63?


HumiSeal® 1C63 is VOC-free and solvent-free, reducing flammability risks. However, proper ventilation is still crucial to prevent inhalation of vapors or spray mist, especially during the curing process. Avoid skin and eye contact. Always consult the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) prior to use for detailed safety guidelines.






### How can I ensure proper application of HumiSeal® 1C63?


HumiSeal® 1C63 fluoresces under UV light, allowing for easy inspection of coating coverage. After application, use a UV light source to check for a uniform, void-free coating, which is critical for high-reliability electronics manufacturing.




### How does HumiSeal® 1C63 perform in harsh environments?


HumiSeal® 1C63 is designed for harsh conditions, with excellent fungus resistance per ASTM G21 and exceptional moisture insulation resistance. It maintains performance in humid, mechanically stressful, or temperature-cycling environments, making it ideal for mission-critical systems.
