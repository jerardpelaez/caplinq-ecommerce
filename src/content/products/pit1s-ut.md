shortDescription: LINQTAPE™ PIT1S-UT Series is a high performance, high-temperature resistant, pressure sensitive polyimide tape designed for both permanent and temporary bonding in many high temperature applications. These applications include but are not limited to semiconductor, smartcard, electronic, automotive and general manufacturing industries. LINQTAPE™ PIT1S-UT Series provides an excellent balance of electrical, mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties over a wide range of temperatures. It can be used in applications that may see temperatures up to 260°C (500°F). LINQTAPE™ PIT1S-UT Series comes in 33 meter (36 yard) length rolls of varying widths. The base polyimide film (backing) thickness is 1 mil (25.4 ± 2µm) thick and the total thickness including the adhesive layer is approximately 1.5 mil (38.1± 2µm).
