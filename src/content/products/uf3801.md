Rework Process:





Component Removal. Component solder joints must be heated above their reflow temperature (260°C to 280°C). At this temperature, the undefill will be soft and easy to remove. Component may then be pulled or removed by twisting or with a use of a vacuum pick-up nozzle.




Site Preparation. After component removal, cleaning of residues may be done by the following methods



- Scraping. Heat the site to 250°C to 300°C and scrape off the underfill carefully avoiding damage of pads on the substrate. Alternatively, heating can also be done from the bottom of the substrate.



Rotating Brush. Apply sufficient amount of pressure onto the brush to clean the residues. Care should be taken to avoid damage to substrate.





- Component Replacement. Isopropanol or a flux pen may be used to ensure no residue remain on the circuit board after cleaning. Brush solder paste or flux on the board and align the new component using vacuum and reflow using hot air. Underfill will likewise be applied followed by cure step.






Storage and Handling


Store and transport below -5°C temperature. Keep away from moisture and heat sources. It is strictly forbidden to store in outdoor environments.
