  - High Thermal Conductivity GR30
  - Designed for TO92 and TO220 packages
  - Excellent reliability under high temperature and bias
shortDescription: Hysol GR350HT is a high thermal conductivity version of GR30. It is a black semiconductor-grade epoxy molding compound (duroplast) designed for the encapsulation and protection of TO92, TO3P, TO220 and TO247 power devices. Once molded and post-mold cured, this product provides optimum protection and reliability for these semiconductor devices. Compared to the standard GR30 version, which has a thermal conductivity of 0.95 W/mK, GR350HT boasts more than twice as much thermal conductivity with 1.6 W/mK while also maintaining the high performance and moldability enhancements over the GR300 roots. Hysol GR350HT is an environmentally "green" product, meaning that it doesn't contain any bromine, antimony or phosphorus flame retardants. Previous MG-series EMC dominated the space for power semiconductors but used halogen-containing flame retardants. This next generation epoxy mold compound replaces these older generation products. This material is designed to achieve JEDEC Level 1 requirements at 260°C reflow temperature on Nickel or Nickel-plated leadframes. It also achieves UL 94 V-0 Flammability at 1/8 inch (3.18mm) thickness.

Designed for TO220 & TO247 devices


TO220 and TO247 are big, bulky packages, so molding these products with a standard mold compound is fairly easy without using any fine fillers. The trouble with these packages however is that epoxy mold compounds used typically fail High Temperature Reverse Bias (HTRB) testing, which exposes the device to humidity and temperature while the device is under BIAS. Devices often experience "gate leakage" under these conditions and fail catastrophically.


Furthermore, these devices are often used using a Nickel (Ni) leadframe, which is very difficult to adhere to. Therefore, epoxy moldng compound must have a very good adhesion to Nickel to achieve MSL1 preconditioning.
