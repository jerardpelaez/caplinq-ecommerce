Recommended Curing Conditions



- 2 hours @ 150°C




Thawing:



- Allow container to reach room temperature before use.

- After removing from the freezer, set the syringes to stand vertically while thawing.

- DO NOT open the container before contents reach 25°C temperature. Any moisture that collects on the thawed container should be removed prior to opening the container.

- DO NOT re-freeze. Once thawed to 25°C, the adhesive should not be re-frozen.




Directions for Use



- Thawed adhesive should immediately be placed on dispense equipment for use.

- If the adhesive is transferred to a final dispensing reservoir, care must be exercised to avoid entrapment of contaminants and/or air into the adhesive.

- Adhesive must be completely used within the product's recommended work life.
