category: underfills
subcategory: underfills
sellingPoints:
  - High Tg
  - Very low viscosity
  - One-component
shortDescription: "LINQBOND UF3802 is a high Tg one-component epoxy adhesive developed for electronic device bonding. It is easy to operate and suitable for various applications, such as casting, sealing, and encapsulation of electronic components. This product cures quickly at high temperatures, reducing working time and increasing efficiency. LINQBOND UF3802 forms tough, strong structural bonds that provide excellent shear, peel, and impact strength. The product's durability is exceptional, capable of passing numerous environmental tests. It has very low viscosity for under-filling CSP and BGA, helps buffer the dilational shrinkage stress of tin balls and mitigates shear stress caused by counteracting forces during drop tests. Cure Schedule 130°C for 30 min Alternative Cure schedule: 150°C for 5 - 8 min"

Instructions for Use:





Before use, thaw the product to reach room temperature for 1–2 hours. The syringe should be placed vertically while thawing. Keep the container airtight until room temperature is reached.




Ensure the surface to be bonded is clean and free of contaminants like dirt, grease, or mold release agents. A simple solvent wipe is often sufficient.




Cure time may vary based on the actual part geometry, material volume, and equipment. It is recommended that the test be done on actual parts and equipment.




For large-scale applications, consider a staged curing process: start with a lower temperature pre-cure, followed by a full cure at a higher temperature to manage heat release effectively.




Cool down gradually after curing to minimize thermal stress.




The epoxy cannot be refrozen once exposed to room temperature.





Rework Process:





Component Removal. Component solder joints must be heated above their reflow temperature (260°C to 280°C). At this temperature, the undefill will be soft and easy to remove. Component may then be pulled or removed by twisting or with a use of a vacuum pick-up nozzle.




Site Preparation. After component removal, cleaning of residues may be done by the following methods






Scraping. Heat the site to 250°C to 300°C and scrape off the underfill carefully avoiding damage of pads on the substrate. Alternatively, heating can also be done from the bottom of the substrate.




Rotating Brush. Apply sufficient amount of pressure onto the brush to clean the residues. Care should be taken to avoid damage to substrate.




- Component Replacement. Isopropanol or a flux pen may be used to ensure no residue remains on the circuit board after cleaning. Brush solder paste or flux on the board and align the new component using a vacuum and reflow using hot air. Underfill will likewise be applied followed by cure step.




Storage and Handling


Store and transport below -5°C temperature. Keep away from moisture and heat sources. It is strictly forbidden to store in outdoor environments.
