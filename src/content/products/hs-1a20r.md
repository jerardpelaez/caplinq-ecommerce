## Frequently Asked Questions About HumiSeal® 1A20R



### What are typical applications for HumiSeal® 1A20R?




HumiSeal® 1A20R is a one-part, moisture-curing polyurethane conformal coating designed to protect printed circuit board assemblies (PCBs) in demanding environments. Its excellent moisture and chemical resistance, along with its wide operating temperature range, make it a reliable choice for a variety of industries, including:



- Military and aerospace electronics (e.g., control modules, avionics)

- Industrial electronics (e.g., motor drives, sensors, process controls)

- Automotive electronics (e.g., electronic control units)

- Instrumentation and monitoring equipment




This coating is particularly well-suited for applications where reliable environmental protection is required and where the use of a simple, one-part, moisture-curing system is preferred.




### Why choose HumiSeal® 1A20R over other conformal coatings?




HumiSeal® 1A20R is a single-component, high-performance polyurethane formulation that cures at ambient temperature and humidity. It provides excellent chemical and moisture resistance. Unlike coatings that require specialized curing equipment, 1A20R cures simply by reacting with atmospheric moisture, making it a cost-effective and easy-to-implement solution. It is a flexible coating with high abrasion resistance, and its viscosity is optimized for spray, brush, or dip application. The coating is compliant with MIL-I-46058C and IPC-CC-830, and it meets the requirements of the RoHS Directive 2011/65/EC (and 2015/863/EU). You can learn how to select a conformal coating in our latest blog.






### What is the shelf life of HumiSeal® 1A20R?


HumiSeal® 1A20R has a shelf life of 6 months from the date of manufacture when stored at 0 to 35°C in a tightly closed container, away from direct sunlight or excessive heat. As it is a moisture-curing material, it is crucial to protect the product from ambient humidity to prevent premature polymerization. Therefore, any open or partial containers should be tightly sealed after use, and ideally purged with a dry, inert gas (e.g., nitrogen or argon) before closure.




### How should I clean tools after applying HumiSeal® 1A20R?


To flush equipment and clean uncured HumiSeal® 1A20R, non-alcohol based solvents like xylene or toluene are suitable. HumiSeal® Thinner 521 is an effective option. For coating removal during rework, the cured film can be difficult to remove. Thermal displacement, mechanical abrasion, and specialized chemical strippers (e.g., HumiSeal® Stripper 1072) are all suitable options for rework.






### What happens to HumiSeal® 1A20R after its shelf life?


After the shelf life, the material's viscosity may increase, and its curing characteristics may degrade. This can lead to improper application, uneven coating, and a reduction in the protective performance of the cured film. The use of expired material is not recommended as it may compromise the quality and reliability of the coating. Due to its moisture-curing nature, proper storage is critical to maintaining product integrity.




### How does HumiSeal® 1A20R cure, and why do curing times vary?


HumiSeal® 1A20R is a single-cure, moisture-curing coating that reacts with atmospheric humidity to form a durable film. The coating has a drying time to handle of 60 minutes and will require 24 hours at room temperature or 3 hours at 76°C to cure. A full cure with optimum properties is achieved within 7 days. Curing times can vary based on ambient conditions; higher temperature and humidity will accelerate the curing process, while lower temperature and humidity will slow it down. Ensuring a well-ventilated and controlled environment is key for a consistent and reliable cure.






### What is the recommended thickness for HumiSeal® 1A20R?


The recommended coating thickness for HumiSeal® 1A20R is 25 to 75 microns (1-3 mils). This thickness range ensures optimal protective performance while maintaining flexibility and electrical properties. The final thickness can be adjusted based on the application method and specific project requirements.




### What are the differences between application methods for HumiSeal® 1A20R?


HumiSeal® 1A20R can be applied by dipping, spraying, or brushing. Dipping is often used for high-volume, automated processes, providing uniform coverage for complex geometries. Spraying, using conventional spray equipment, is ideal for selective application and achieving a consistent film. Brushing is suitable for rework or small-scale applications, offering precise control in localized areas. For all methods, ensuring a dry, inert gas source for any spray equipment is crucial to prevent premature curing.






### What is the maximum operating temperature for HumiSeal® 1A20R?


HumiSeal® 1A20R has a continuous use operating temperature range of –65°C to +125°C, providing consistent protection across a wide range of thermal conditions. It is capable of withstanding thermal shock within this range, as demonstrated by its compliance with MIL-I-46058C testing.




### What safety precautions should I take when using HumiSeal® 1A20R?


HumiSeal® 1A20R contains flammable solvents, so it should be used in well-ventilated areas and kept away from open flames or sparks. Prevent skin and eye contact by wearing appropriate personal protective equipment, including safety glasses and solvent-resistant gloves. Avoid inhalation of vapors and spray mist. Always consult the product's Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for detailed handling, storage, and disposal information.






### How can I ensure proper application of HumiSeal® 1A20R?


HumiSeal® 1A20R contains a UV fluorescent tracer, which makes it easy to inspect for proper coverage. Under a UV lamp, the coating will fluoresce, allowing visual confirmation of uniform application and film integrity. This feature is essential for quality control and process monitoring, ensuring all required areas of the PCB have been coated uniformly. Test coupons can be used to periodically check thickness and cure quality.




### How does HumiSeal® 1A20R perform in harsh environments?


HumiSeal® 1A20R provides excellent protection against moisture, humidity, and chemical exposure. The cured polyurethane film is tough and flexible, ensuring long-term integrity against environmental stressors. This makes it an ideal solution for applications where PCBs are exposed to corrosive agents, moisture, or significant temperature fluctuations, such as in military or industrial settings.
