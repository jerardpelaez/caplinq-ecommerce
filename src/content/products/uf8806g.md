### Is there a recommended method for die depopulation?


We do not know of any “magic trick” or any easy process to remove packages with these underfills. UF8806G is based on Cyanate Ester chemistry, so it is different to epoxies such as UF3915 even though both products are very robust, and are designed to form a permanent bond.


There are no “solvents” that will easily dissolve the resin. Some acids should attack it (a heated mixture of concentrated Nitric + Sulphuric acid could work) but it is very hazardous and will also attack the board/substrate.


The only practical way to remove the packages (or chips) is to heat up to around 250°C (or at least sufficiently hot to melt the solder) and either twist the package or prise it upward to peel it away from the board/substrate.
