Adhesion properties of ABP8064T




It's stated clearly in the TDS that it needs a N2 oven. Is this a prerequisite? Can it be cured in a conventional oven and if so how will this change the cure schedule?


Many customers prefer to cure in Nitrogen, to protect components from oxidation. However, please look at the 8064T data package – slide 33. It states that cure in Air or Nitrogen is OK. Justification data is on slides 30 to 32. It’s rather mathematical, but shows that die shear strength is not significantly affected by the curing atmosphere.




Would this epoxy be suitable to attach a Au plated copper tab to a Ag plated aluminium heatsink?


It is difficult to say. Our recommendation for 5mmx5mm max size is based on Silicon to Cu leadframe. (Expansion Coefficients are very different – 3ppm/C vs. 18ppm/C, so we get a lot of stress from this). However, you are bonding Copper (18 ppm/C) to Aluminium (23 ppm/C), so the expansion mismatch is smaller (about 5ppm/c vs 15ppm/C). So we would say that its worth trying ABP8064T
