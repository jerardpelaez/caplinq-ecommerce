shortDescription: LOCTITE GC 10 is a multi purpose halogen free, zero halogens added, no-clean, low voiding, Pb-free solder paste specially formulated to provide added long term stability over a wide range of temperature conditions. The enhanced paste stability created through its novel formulation strategy increases both field application yields and on-line paste utilization. It is based on SAC305 with multiple powder forms that are distinguished by their Particle size distribution (T3, T4, T5 ranging from 15 to 45um). T3 is the standard particle size, T4 is for smaller component soldering and T5 for very small components like in SiP. LOCTITE GC 10 also shows excellent solderability when reflowed in both air and nitrogen across a wide range of challenging surface finishes and component metallizations including immersion Ag, OSP-Cu, ENIG and CuNiZn. It supports excellent reflow to overcome industry wide HiP and NWO challenges. The new flux chemistry protects the solder joint longer, improves coalescence and optimizes wetting performance, allowing for very shiny solder joints. It is suitable for use with industry standard SAC alloys. LOCTITE GC 10 is as Halogen-free flux that passes IC with pretreatment IPC-TM-650 /EN14582 with a ROL0 classification to ANSI/J-STD-004Rev. B. It is ideal for printing down to 0.3 mm pitch with up to 72 hours stencil life and 24 hours abandon time that make it suitable for high speed printing (up to 125mms/1) with an improved paste transfer efficiency. More importantly it exhibits an enhanced process window with superior coalesence and wetting and minimal hot slump at 182°C. A product that produces shiny solder joints with clear, colourless residues for easy post reflow inspection.

LOCTITE GC 10 contains a stable resin system with slow evaporating solvents and minimal odor. The formulation has been tested to the requirements of the ANSI/J-STD-004B for a type ROL0 classification specification .


Storage: Optimal storage: 5 to 25oC (± 1.5°C) Storage information may be indicated on the product container labelling. Material removed from containers may be contaminated during use. Do not return products to the original container. Henkel Corporation cannot assume responsibility for product that has been contaminated or stored under conditions other than those previously indicated. If additional information is required, please contact your local Technical Service Center or Customer Service Representative.


Shelf Life: Provided that LOCTITE GC 10 is stored in the original container, a minimum shelf life of 365 days at 5 to 25 °C(± 1.5°C) or 31 days at 40°C can be expected. If stored below 20 °C, allow to stabilize to at least 23°C. Do not use forced heating methods to bring the solder paste up to temperature.
