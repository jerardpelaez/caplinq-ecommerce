shortDescription: TG2800I Thermal Silicone Grease provides superior thermal performance with ease of use across a multitude of applications. Its low viscosity and excellent thixotropy make it fit for large–scale production with dispensing, screen printing and stencil printing. TG2800I is developed with 2.8 TC and 0.009 TI to meet basic power density requirements. It is designed to minimize thermal resistance at interfaces, and maintain excellent performance through reliability testing Thermal greases are available with different BLT to meet different interface flatness. TG2000I in particular can reach a bond line thickness of 25 micron @35psi, 50oC. Its operating temperature range is -40oC to 150oC similar to the entire Thermal grease product range.
