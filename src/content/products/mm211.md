shortDescription: MM-211 is an intermediate chain length, maleimide, terminated carboxylic acid. It is a useful intermediate for the synthesis of ester and amide linked thermoset monomers. The alkyl chain provides flexibility and hydrophobicity. MM-211 is recommended for use as a synthetic intermediate for maleimide functional resins. It may also be used as an adhesion promoter in free-radical or epoxy/(meth)acrylate hybrid adhesives to bind on metal surfaces.
