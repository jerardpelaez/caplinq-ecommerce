## Product Description

LinQTherm PCM-45 is a phase change thermal interface material that combines the handling convenience of a solid pad with the thermal performance of a grease. Supplied as a dry, non-tacky film at room temperature, the PCM-45 undergoes a phase transition at 45 °C, softening to fill microscopic surface irregularities and achieve ultra-thin bond lines. This phase change behavior results in a thermal impedance as low as 0.05 °C*cm2/W, rivaling the performance of high-end thermal greases without the mess and pump-out concerns.

The PCM-45 is supplied on a carrier film at a thickness of 0.13 mm and can be die-cut to match specific component footprints. It is applied like a pad -- simply peel and place -- and transitions to its working state during the first power-on cycle of the device. Once the phase change occurs, the material conforms intimately to both mating surfaces, displacing trapped air and creating a continuous thermal path with minimal interfacial resistance.

Unlike thermal greases, the PCM-45 does not migrate, pump out, or dry out over time, providing consistent thermal performance throughout the product life. It is electrically insulating, halogen-free, and RoHS compliant, making it an ideal choice for reliability-sensitive consumer electronics, telecommunications, and data center equipment where long service intervals and maintenance-free operation are valued.

## Key Features

- Phase change at 45 °C for optimal performance at typical operating temperatures
- Thermal conductivity of 3.5 W/mK above transition temperature
- Ultra-low thermal impedance comparable to thermal greases
- Dry, non-tacky handling at room temperature
- No pump-out, migration, or dry-out over product lifetime
- Pre-cut or die-cut shapes for simplified assembly
- Electrically insulating, halogen-free, and RoHS compliant

## Applications

LinQTherm PCM-45 is ideally suited for thermal interfacing between high-power processors (CPUs, GPUs, ASICs) and their heat sinks in servers, workstations, and networking equipment. Its clean handling and consistent long-term performance make it a preferred choice in data center environments where thermal paste maintenance is impractical. The PCM-45 is also used in telecom base stations, industrial computers, and high-reliability consumer electronics where thermal stability must be maintained over many years of continuous operation.
