shortDescription: "OPTOLINQ TMC-9000T is a high-performance optical solid epoxy specifically developed for white decorative and backlight LED encapsulation. This monocomponent epoxy achieves superior adhesion performance and great transmittance. Its stability at high temperature aids towards a good package performance and long life. More important, TMC-9000T applies transparent filler technology to achieve low CTE and low moisture absoprtion. TMC-9000T is developed based on TMC-8060 formula, which is able to offer low blue-ray decay for outdoor LED applications and overall great light performance. This anti yellowing white epoxy is very close to competitive solutions such as XX814, XX1000 and XX97.

To meet higher MSL test requirements, clear molding compound is expected to have (1) low moisture absorption; (2) low stress generated; (3) low CTE. Our filler technology could helpmeet these challenges. With the content of filler increasing in TMC-9000T, the CTE and water absorption both decrease. Meanwhile, TMC-9000T is based on the TMC-8060 product platform, TMC-9000T remains the superior anti-blue decay property as TMC-8060. Worth to be mention, the straight light R-transmittance will also decrease a lot with filler content increase. Thus, we usually keep the filler content in the range of 40~80% based on specific application needs.




### TMC-9000T High Temperature Stability


TMC-9000T is developed based on TMC-8060, thus TMC-9000T keeps superior anti-blue decay property as TMC-8060. As you can tell from the heat storage test curve below, TMC-9000T transmittance decay is lower than 15% under 150°C for 1000hours.




### TMC-9000T Filler Content Effect


As the filler content in TMC-9000T increases, the CTE decreases and water absorption decrease. With low CTE, the strain during temperature change is also low. The improved moisture resistance ability gives TMC-9000T higher chance to pass MSL requirements.
