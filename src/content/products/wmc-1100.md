### Processing Instructions



- Before use, allow WMC-1100 to reach room temperature for a minimum of 8 hours, ensuring the bag remains unopened to prevent moisture contamination.

- Apply an outer releasing agent, such as silicones or fluorinated compounds, to the mold surface to facilitate easy release from the mold dies.

- Prior to molding with WMC-1100 or any new material, the mold should be cleaned thoroughly. For proper mold conditioning, the initial three shots should be cured for 5–10 minutes. After this initial conditioning period, you can reduce the curing time to a level that provides sufficient hot hardness for effective release.




### Storage and Handling


OPTOLINQ WMC-1100 is available in pressed pellets in a wide range of sizes to meet specific customer needs. To ensure product integrity, keep it away from oxidizing materials. For long-term storage, maintain a cold environment, ideally at –20 °C or lower. The shelf life under this condition is 12 months.
