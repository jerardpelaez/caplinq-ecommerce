  - UV cured, no hard bake required
  - Excellent dielectric properties
shortDescription: DMI’s stress buffer coating is a negative type, solvent developed, photosensitive polyimide based precursor for stress buffer applications. DMI’s photosensitive polyimide coating uses a modified polymide which outperforms industry standards because of its very low cure temperature and very low modulus. These two qualities ensure that there is minimum wafer warpage of the silicon wafer. DMI’s photosensitive polyimide coating also guarantees excellent cured film properties such as great electrical performance because of its high dielectric strength and constant. The coating has a very low moisture absorption and high elongation giving it its high reliability. DMI's photosensitive polyimide coating's main application is as a stress buffer or wafer buffer layer in wafer level packaging (WLP). The coating's low cure temperature and high dielectric strength ensure excellent performance as stress buffer in wafer level packaging. Other applications include post passivation layers for solder bumping or dielectric layer in wafer level packages.

We would like to pattern the DMI-3006. Do we need the R1247 developer or can we use a mixture of conventional solvents?




We can supply the material but we would prefer if you prepared your own supply for two reasons:



- You likely have these solvents in your inventory

- Shipping flammable solvents is very expensive




The R1247 is a simple mixture of 85 wt. % cyclopentanone (a common solvent used for developing) and 15 wt. % ethanol. We just add the two solvents to a container and shake to blend them together. We have found that pure cyclopentanone is a little too aggressive to the DMI-3006 so blending with ethanol reduces its nature.
