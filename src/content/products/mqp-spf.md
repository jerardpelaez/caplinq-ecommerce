shortDescription: MQP-SPF Fused Spherical Micro Quartz Powder is the Fused version of MQP-SP. It consists of ultra fine spherical silica particles with an SiO2 content of 99.97% and is commonly used as a fine EMC filler for semiconductors. Additionally it can be used in Copper claded layers to improve their CTE, thermal resistance and reliability. MQP-SPF has fewer ionic impurities and low alpha ray emissions while also maintaining a very high purity. Its ultra fine nature makes it ideal for PCB printing inks. It helps with resistance to scratching and wiping, it lowers the CTE and brings long term reliability to the circuit board. MQP-SPF can finally be used in paints and coatings, assisting with the leveling properties, transparency and weather resistance of the materials. The particle size is adjusted to the customer requirements and can range from 7μm to 75μm (D50). We can offer fused spherical silica powders larger than 25 micron (D50) (low alpha high purity of > 99.97% SiO2) while smaller particle sizes are available after consultation.
