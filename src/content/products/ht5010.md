shortDescription: Honeywell HT5010 silicone based one-part thermal gel - Gap Filler provides a thermal conductivity of 5.2 W/m·K along with high conformability and high compressibility. It is one of the most popular thermal gels, formulated to deliver high dispense rates for improved productivity, long-term reliability performance and easy reworkability. The thickness range to prevent slumping in vertical position is 0.3-1.5mm. This is a non factor when components are mounted horizontally. Honeywell HT5010 is designed to minimize thermal resistance at interfaces, maintain excellent performance through reliability testing, and provide scalable application at a competitive cost. The minimum bondline thickness that it can reach is 0.14mm with a Thermal Impedance of 0.28. Additionally it performs great in oil, crack and slump testing and it exhibits no pump out and cracking risk. Honeywell HT5010 has a flow rate above 14 g/min, high breakdown strength (above 5 kV/mm) and very low out gassing (below 0.05%). HT 5010 is the improved version of the discontinued HT 5000. HT 5010 has been formulated to outperform competitive products such as TCXX by all metrics. Better dispense rate, better thermal conductivity and smaller bondline thickness. This, combined with minimal oil bleeding in RT and 80°C and minimal dripping and cracking, makes HT5010 the best product in the mid range, one part hybrid, thermal interface material category.

### Compressibility Testing


Testing shows that the HT5010 gel, with an initial thickness of 1mm, can be compressed to 200μm under 5 psi. The Thermal Impedance (TI) value in our Technical Data Sheet (TDS) is 0.26 K-in²/W at 10 psi. As a pre-cured, soft gel, HT5010 compresses easily, meaning the TI at 5 psi will be slightly higher than at 10 psi but remains comparable.


HT5010 is designed for applications where low compression force and efficient thermal conductivity are essential, offering reliable thermal management with minimal applied pressure.
