shortDescription: Hysol GR2310V is a long flow, long-gel time version of GR2310. It is gold (yellow) in color and is a semiconductor-grade epoxy molding compound or duroplast designed for the encapsulation and protection of Manganese Oxide (MnO2) tantalum capacitors and automotive sensor packages. Once molded and post-mold cured, this product provides optimium protection and reliability for these capacitor devices. Hysol GR2310V is a laser markable, environmentally "green" product, meaning that doesn't contain any halogens including bromine, antimony or phosphorus flame retardants. MG33F-0520 and MG33F-0602 dominated the space for tantalum capacitors but used halogen-containing flame retardants. This next generation epoxy mold compound replaces these older generation products. It is designed to achieve JEDEC Level 1 requirements at 260°C reflow temperature. Its fast cure time ensures that it is compatible with the latest automold manufacturing equipment. Hysol GR2310V meets UL 94 V-0 Flammability at 1/4 inch (6.35mm) thickness.

Tantalum capacitors are general purpose mature products and as such, the products used to mold them must be cost-competitive. Although the GR2310V has "only" been manufactured for 15 years or so, it has been optimised as to offer the lowest cost possible for a non halogen containing formulation.
