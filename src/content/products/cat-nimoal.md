  - Optimized as cathode for alkaline water electrolyzers
shortDescription: "LINQCELL CAT-NiMoAl is a nickel-based electrode with nickel alloy catalyst layer deposited through plasma spray coating. It registers low overpotential for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the cathodic reaction in electrochemical water splitting. While platinum is traditionally used to catalyze HER, its scarcity and high cost make transition metals like nickel strong alternatives. Nickel, in particular, demonstrates exceptional catalytic activity in alkaline solutions. CAT-NiMoAl is an improved version based on a ternary nickel–molybdenum–aluminum alloy, offering performance comparable to that of the benchmark platinum electrode, making LINQCELL CAT-NiMoAl a reliable, cost-effective, and high-performance cathode for alkaline water electrolyzers. Key Features: Strong Catalytic Activity: The cathode demonstrates strong catalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), crucial for efficient water splitting. This version is comparable to platinum. Excellent Stability: The cathodes have maintained their coating adhesion, voltage, and overall performance after 1000 hours of testing under a constant current of 10000 A/m2. Cost-Effective Alternative to Platinum: By using nickel-based alloys and a nickel alloy catalyst layer, the LINQCELL CAT-NiMoAl provides a more affordable solution compared to traditional platinum-based catalysts. Highly Recommended for: Alkaline water electrolyzers, specifically as cathode for hydrogen production. LINQCELL CAT-NiMoAl comes in different sizes to meet various device design requirements.

## Woven Mesh Substrate Options for LINQCELL CAT-NiMoAl

### Mesh 4019

### Mesh 4619

### Mesh 4625

### What Does Woven Mesh Nomenclature, like &ldquo;4619&rdquo;, Mean?

Woven mesh nomenclature uses two parameters: mesh count and wire diameter. Mesh count is openings per inch (e.g., &ldquo;46&rdquo;), and wire diameter is the wire thickness (e.g., &ldquo;19&rdquo; = 0.019 mm). These set aperture size, open area, and strength. A 4619 mesh therefore has 46 openings per inch made from 0.019 mm wires&mdash;suited to filtration, screening, and electrochemical applications.

CAPLINQ&rsquo;s nickel wire meshes, NWM250 and NWM300, feature 0.25 mm (250 &micro;m) and 0.30 mm (300 &micro;m) wire diameters, offering excellent conductivity, corrosion resistance, and durability for electrochemical/high-temperature environments.

### High-Rigidity Nickel Substrates for NiMoAl Cathode Catalysts

High-rigidity nickel substrates support stable NiMoAl cathodes. CAPLINQ supplies perforated nickel sheets (round openings) and expanded nickel sheets (diamond openings) engineered for high mechanical strength and dimensional stability, ensuring uniform current distribution, low contact resistance, and efficient gas removal.

### Test Protocol

The HER overpotential tests were carried out using a standard three-electrode setup with 30 wt% KOH as the electrolyte, maintained at 80 &plusmn; 1 &deg;C.

Working Electrode Activation and Stabilization. The working electrode, with a 1 cm&sup2; active area, was first stabilized by running 20 CV cycles between &ndash;1.5 V and &ndash;0.9 V at a scan rate of 100 mV/s.

Linear Sweep Voltammetry. Once stable, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was performed over the same potential range at 5 mV/s. Measurements were repeated until two consecutive scans showed less than 2 mV variation at a current density of &ndash;5000 A/m&sup2;. The reported overpotential values represent the average of these consistent readings at &ndash;5000 A/m&sup2; vs. RHE, with a reproducibility margin of &plusmn;2 mV.
