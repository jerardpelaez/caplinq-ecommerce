shortDescription: ODF-10 Diffusing agent is a light diffusing agent commonly used in LED applications. The main function of a diffusing agent is to evenly diffuse the light emitted by the LED chip in the resin. This makes products using this material to emit a soft and consistent luminosity. ODF-10 diffusing agent is a low viscosity (±20,000 mPas) milky white liquid that has a small effect on the LED's brightness. It is suitable for the production of various luminous products such as LED Lamps and LED Displays. ODF-10 has low viscosity and good compatibility with A/B resins, so it can be used directly. ODF Type S offers a stronger diffusing effect than ODF-10. Both products use the same dispersant materials. Amounts added to resin can be adjusted to match the required diffusion.

Processing Instructions







Stir and preheat the agent at 70~80°C.




Directly add the diffusing agent to A/B resin that will be used and stir uniformly.




Defoam the mixture for 5 minutes and use the mixture within pot life of the resin used.




Curing conditions of the the resin used should be followed.







Precautions







Do not preheat for a long time to avoid sedimentation and difficulty in stirring.




A small amount of resin will float out after long-term storage of this product. This is a normal phenomenon. Please stir well before use.







Storage and Handling




Store in a ventilated, dry, and clean environment below 25°C and 70% humidity. Keep away from fire and heat sources. It is strictly forbidden to store in outdoor environments. At proper storage conditions, the product has a shelf life of 6 months.
