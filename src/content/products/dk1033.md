shortDescription: "High Productivity Epoxy Coating Powder for Slot Insulation of Motor Armatures and Stators DK7-3100 is an automotive-grade epoxy coating powder designed for high torque / high power motor armatures used in power closure and ABS motors, but can also be used in other automotive enclosure and fuel pump motors. DK7-3100 provides superior edge coverage and high cut through temperatures which improves the lifetime of the motor by keeping the copper insulated from the armature even after several peaks at high temperatures. DK7-3100 is submitted to UL as a candidate for UL EIS 1446 180°C (Class H) rating. DK7-3100 was developed specifically for high speed production on the latest generation of Braun Sondermachinen electrostatic fluidized bed equipment, but works equally well on other equipment.
