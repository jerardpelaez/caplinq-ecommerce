shortDescription: A-1100 is a proprietary non-halogenated additive designed to reduce resin bleed out on a variety of surfaces with minimal or no affect on the adhesion properties of the formulation. It shows excellent results when used in non-metal filled systems after reducing bleed. It is co-curable in free-radical polymerization. It also can enhance the rheological properties of various filled adhesives. A-1100 is recommended for use as an additive to reduce resin bleed out specifically on metal surfaces and has more acid functionality per molecule then A-1050. The recommended addition of the A-1100 to a formulation is between 0.5% - 1% weight percent of resin. It shows superior bleed control in formulations that contain non-metal fillers such as silica.

Epoxy Resin Incompatibility


A1100 rely on acid functionality to bond in and prevent bleeding. Unfortunately thiol group react with epoxy resin instead of substrate reducing or even eliminating the resin bleed functionality.




Molecular Weight Estimation


We do not specifically measure the M.W. for this material and instead rely on the average M.W. of the starting material and the functionality (thiol group) that makes the product.
