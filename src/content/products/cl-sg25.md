## Frequently Asked questions


How are Graphite sheets made?


COOLINQ SG25 Graphite Sheets are manufactured using advanced processes that ensure consistency and precision. Our proprietary manufacturing techniques result in sheets with uniform thickness, exceptional thermal conductivity, and minimal defects. This level of quality control ensures that every sheet you receive meets the highest industry standards.


Are graphite sheets better than metal spreaders?


COOLINQ SG25 Graphite Sheets have a clear advantage over traditional heat-spreading technologies, particularly those of the same thickness. Conventional materials like metal heat spreaders are heavier and less flexible, limiting their applicability in compact and lightweight electronic devices. In contrast, COOLINQ SG25's ultra-thin profile at just 0.025mm offers an unprecedented combination of heat spreading efficiency and flexibility. It's remarkably lightweight and can be effortlessly integrated into even the most space-constrained electronics.


What is the Thermal Conductivity of Graphite sheets?


What sets COOLINQ SG25 apart is its remarkable thermal conductivity, which surpasses that of many other materials at the same thickness. Thanks to its highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) composition, it excels at rapidly conducting heat in both the X-Y (1500 W/mK) and Z (10W/mK) directions. This makes it an ideal choice for scenarios where efficient heat dissipation is paramount.




## Handling and Storage





Handling: To prevent contact with graphite powder, it is advisable to wear gloves and a smock during handling.




Storage: Store the product away from potential ignition sources and oxidizing materials. Ensure it is kept in a cool, dry place, sealed tightly within a container.





Operator Protection





Adequate ventilation is recommended during operation.




While no specific skin protection is necessary, it is advisable to use eye protection when working with the product.




Due to its high thermal conductivity, avoid direct contact with the product when the operating temperature exceeds 60°C or falls below freezing.





Safety Precautions





Strictly adhere to the specified working temperature range of -50 to 250°C.




Avoid using the product with acidic substances.




Prevent any rough handling, rubbing, or collision with sharp objects.




When cutting the product, use a knife rather than tearing it by hand.
