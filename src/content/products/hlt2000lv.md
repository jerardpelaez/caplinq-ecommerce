shortDescription: Honeywell HLT 2000LV is a two-part, dispensable thermally conductive gel, which offers long-term reliability and superior softness. Its properties are identical to HLT2000 and the main differences are the slightly lower Thermal impedance (0.60), lower volatility and longer Cure time at room temperature. The enhanced bonding force between the polymer base and the filler largely improves the thermally conductive gel oil separation issue in storage. Prior to curing, the material maintains good thixotropic characteristics and low viscosity to be easily dispensed. Honeywell HLT 2000LV can be cured in short time after two-component mixing at room temperature. The high compressibility minimizes thermal resistance at interfaces, while maintaining excellent performance during reliability testing. The product can be cured at either 16 hours at Room temperature or 30minutes at 100°C. Of course those are just indications and you can experiment with curing for your application needs.
