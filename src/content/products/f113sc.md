### How to use



- Carefully clean and dry all surfaces to be bonded

- Remove clamp and thoroughly mix the LOCTITE ECCOBOND F113SC epoxy adhesive system components in the handy BIPAX mixing-dispenser package until color is uniform throughout

- Apply this completely mixed adhesive to the prepared surfaces, and gently press these surfaces together. Contact pressure is adequate for strong, reliable bonds; however, maintain contact until adhesive is completely cured

- Some separation of components is common during shipping and storage. For this reason, it is recommended that the contents of the shipping container be thoroughly mixed prior to use

- Some ingredients in this formulation provided in BIPAX, TRA-PAX and bulk packaging may crystallize when subjected to low temperature storage. A gentle warming cycle of 52ºC for 30 minutes prior to mixing components may be necessary. Crystallized epoxy components do not react as well as liquid components and should be redissolved prior to use for best results
