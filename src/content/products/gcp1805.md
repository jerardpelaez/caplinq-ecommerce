### GCP 1805 Main Applications

Linqsol GCP1805 is an UL 94 V-0 listed halogen-free product and pass UL RTI rating of 130 &deg;C. With excellent dielectric properties and low moisture absorption, GCP1805 works best for your passive component applications, including capacitors, resistors, inductors, etc.

 
  GCP 1805 For Toroid Cores Insulation****

Inductor powder cores are coated with epoxy powders to insulate and protect the core from copper wires. To maintain stability and avoid affecting magnectic properties or inductance values, epoxy coating powders must minimize core stress by having low shrinkage and low moisture absorption.

Key Application Considerations

- Magnetic property retention (inductance & loss) is critical

- Parts are made in continuous manufacturing process

- Reducing core stress maintains stability of inductance value

- Parts are preheated, but not post-cured

Key Material Requirements

- Low temperature curing and fast cure speed

- Low shrinkage to reduce core stress

- Low moisture absorption to reduce core stress

 

### GCP 1805 Competitive Analysis

It could be seen from the table that the properties of GCP1805 are quite similar to DK18-05. The important features are the optimized pickup temperature and the low cure temperatures as low as 110&deg;C. GCP1805 is expected to have a similar coating performance as DK18-05. It is suggested to coat GCP1805 powder for your passive components under the same preheating and curing conditions for DK18-05. Based on the trial results, the coating process could be further adjusted and optimized.
