shortDescription: "LINQCELL VRB-AEM30 is a 30-µm partially fluorinated anion exchange membrane without reinforcement. It has low ohmic resistance, excellent mechanical properties, low water uptake, and minimal dimensional swelling. VRB-AEM30 has high oxidative stability, resists chlorine, and remains stable in acidic environments (pH > 4). The recommended operating temperature is from room temperature to 50 °C. LINQCELL VRB-AEM30 is highly suitable for electrochemical applications that require exceptional oxidative stability and chlorine resistance, such as redox flow batteries operating with very harsh, aqueous acidic solutions. Key Features and Benefits: Ultra-Low Ohmic Resistance: Minimizes energy losses and maximizes efficiency. Exceptional Oxidative Stability and Chlorine Resistance: Withstands harsh chemical environments, including exposure to chlorine. Minimal Water Uptake and Dimensional Swelling: Maintains stability and consistent performance over time. Highly Recommended for: Vanadium-Redox-Flow Batteries (VRBs) Aqueous Acidic Redox-Flow Batteries. LINQCELL VRB-AEM30 comes in different sizes to meet various device design requirements. Contact us for custom sizes or other specific requirements."
