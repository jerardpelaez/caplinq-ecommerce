shortDescription: LPK-SZBICE is a shape-retaining cooling element, filled with a sponge and a cooling gel. Due to its unique sponge core, LPK-SZBICE maintains its shape both when frozen and unfrozen, ensuring consistent performance throughout its use. As standard, it is designed to keep your products at a stable temperature of 0ºC to 8ºC for several days, provided it is packed in a well-insulated package with adequate cooling capacity. This allows your shipment to remain cool during transport without relying on external power sources. For optimal performance, freeze it for at least 24 hours at -18ºC before use. Other temperature ranges are also available upon request. LPK-SZBICE is available from stock in 1100 grams (19×30 cm). However, thanks to our in-house production facility, we offer extensive customization and personalization options to meet your specific needs. Whether you require a different size or a tailored solution, we are ready to assist you. LPK-SZBICE can be refrozen and reused multiple times. Before reuse, check for any visible damage to ensure optimal performance. At the end of its useful life, it can be disposed of in residual waste in its entirety.
