## Frequently Asked Questions About HumiSeal® 1B51NS



### What are typical applications for HumiSeal® 1B51NS?




HumiSeal® 1B51NS is a single-component, moisture-curing polyurethane conformal coating used for protecting printed circuit board assemblies (PCBs) in various industries, including:



- Aerospace systems (e.g., avionics, control modules)

- Automotive electronics (e.g., engine control units, sensors)

- Industrial automation (e.g., motor drives, PLCs)

- Marine electronics (e.g., navigational equipment)






### Why choose HumiSeal® 1B51NS over other conformal coatings?




HumiSeal® 1B51NS offers excellent flexibility, superior moisture resistance, and great adhesion. As a polyurethane, it provides a tough, chemical-resistant finish and offers excellent electrical insulation. It also fluoresces under UV light for easy inspection and meets key industry standards such as MIL-I-46058C and RoHS 2002/95/EC.








### What is the shelf life of HumiSeal® 1B51NS?


HumiSeal® 1B51NS has a shelf life of 18 months from the date of manufacture when stored at room temperature (18 to 32°C) in a dry place with tightly closed containers.




### How should I clean tools after applying HumiSeal® 1B51NS?


Tools and equipment used for applying HumiSeal® 1B51NS can be cleaned with HumiSeal® Thinner 905 or other suitable solvents such as xylene or toluene. For removing the coating from PCBs during rework, use HumiSeal® Stripper 1080 or a similar product. Always use a lint-free cloth and ensure proper ventilation.








### What happens to HumiSeal® 1B51NS after its shelf life?


After its 18-month shelf life, HumiSeal® 1B51NS may begin to cure inside the container due to exposure to moisture, leading to a significant increase in viscosity or gelling. Using expired material is not recommended as it may result in poor application and compromised performance. The manufacturer will not be liable for quality issues with expired product.




### Why do curing times vary for HumiSeal® 1B51NS?


HumiSeal® 1B51NS cures by reacting with moisture in the air. Therefore, curing times depend heavily on ambient humidity, temperature, and film thickness. Typically, the coating is tack-free in 10 minutes and fully cured in 24 hours at room temperature (25°C) and 50% relative humidity.








### What is the recommended thickness for HumiSeal® 1B51NS?


The recommended dry film thickness for HumiSeal® 1B51NS is 25 to 75 microns. Achieving this range ensures optimal protection, especially for electrical insulation and moisture resistance. The viscosity of the coating can be adjusted with HumiSeal® Thinner 905 to achieve the desired thickness for different application methods.




### What are the differences between application methods for HumiSeal® 1B51NS?


HumiSeal® 1B51NS can be applied via spraying, dipping, or brushing. Spraying and dipping are ideal for high-volume, uniform coverage, while brushing is suitable for small repairs or touch-ups. Each method requires careful control of viscosity and film thickness to ensure a consistent, defect-free coating.








### What is the maximum operating temperature for HumiSeal® 1B51NS?


HumiSeal® 1B51NS has a thermal shock resistance from -65°C to +125°C. The coating is not recommended for continuous operation above 125°C, as prolonged exposure to higher temperatures can degrade its protective properties.




### What safety precautions should I take when using HumiSeal® 1B51NS?


HumiSeal® 1B51NS contains flammable solvents, so it should be used in a well-ventilated area, away from open flames or sparks. Proper personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, eye protection, and a respirator are recommended to prevent skin contact and vapor inhalation. Always consult the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for detailed safety guidelines.








### How can I ensure proper application of HumiSeal® 1B51NS?


HumiSeal® 1B51NS contains a UV tracer that causes it to fluoresce under UV light. This feature allows for quick and easy inspection of the coating to ensure uniform coverage and detect any missed areas, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the circuit board.




### How does HumiSeal® 1B51NS perform in harsh environments?


HumiSeal® 1B51NS provides excellent protection against moisture, humidity, and contaminants. Its durable synthetic rubber composition creates a barrier that guards against electrical leakage and corrosion, making it suitable for demanding applications exposed to harsh environmental conditions.
