Preparation Instructions


1. Ensure the mold temperature is appropriate for cleaning, typically around the operating temperature of the mold. Make sure the mold is free from any significant debris or loose contaminants. 2. Place the MCL-T20 tablets into the mold cavity. The number of tablets depends on the size of the mold and the level of contamination. 3. Close the mold and initiate a standard transfer molding cycle. This includes applying the necessary pressure and heat to activate the cleaning compound. The heat and pressure help the MCL-T20 tablets to flow across the mold surfaces, effectively loosening and removing organic and inorganic residues. 4. After the cycle is complete, open the mold and eject the cleaning compound residue. Inspect the mold for any remaining contaminants. If necessary, repeat the process using additional tablets or in combination with other cleaning methods, such as CHEMLINQ RCS rubber cleaning sheets. 5. Perform a final inspection to ensure all residues are removed.


Storage and Handling


1. The cleaning compound is sealed in PE bags, with 10 kg per carton. 2. Ensure the product stays dry, as high humidity can cause curing failures in the cleaning compound. Keep the product away from heat sources, as excessive heat can make the cleaning compounds ineffective. 3. Store the product below 25 °C. If taken from a cold room or refrigerator, thaw it in the sealed package for 18 to 24 hours until it reaches room temperature. 4. The shelf life is 6 months if stored at temperatures ≤ 25 °C and 12 months at temperatures ≤10 °C.
