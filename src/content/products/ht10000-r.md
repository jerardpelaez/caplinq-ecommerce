HT10000-R Reliability Test

To evaluate the reliability of HT10000-R under extreme conditions, a series of reliability tests were conducted, including high temperature baking, high temperature and high humidity testing, and thermal shock testing. The thermal impedance results remained nearly constant throughout all tests, indicating that no material degradation occurred during exposure. The slight decrease in thermal resistance from the initial 𝑇0 is a positive indication, suggesting that the phase change material progressively filled microscopic air gaps at the interface, thereby enhancing the overall surface thermal contact. High Temperature Baking

This test aims to evaluate the material&rsquo;s thermal stability and resistance to degradation when exposed to elevated temperatures over an extended period. It helps assess whether prolonged heat exposure affects the material&rsquo;s thermal performance, integrity, or reliability.

Test Method Specifications: Test Condition: Samples together with the fixtures are maintained at 150℃ thermal baking chamber Test Duration: 1000 hours Samples Frequency: 3 batches with 3 samples per batch were tested

High Temperature & High Humidity Testing

This test aims to evaluate the material&rsquo;s stability and reliability when exposed to prolonged high temperature and humidity conditions. It helps determine whether any physical, chemical, or performance degradation occurs under accelerated environmental stress.

Test Method Specifications: Test Condition: Samples together with the fixtures are maintained at 85℃ temperature and 85% high humidity environment Test Duration: 1000 hours Samples Frequency: 3 batches with 3 samples per batch were tested

Thermal Shock Testing

This test aims to evaluate the material&rsquo;s durability and reliability when subjected to rapid temperature changes between high and low extremes. It assesses the material&rsquo;s ability to withstand thermal stress and maintain consistent performance without cracking, delamination, or degradation of thermal properties.

Test Method Specifications: Test Condition: Samples together with the fixtures are transitioned between -40℃ and 150 ℃ with 1hr for one cycle, the transfer time is less than 10 seconds Number of cycles: 1000 cycles Samples Frequency: 3 batches with 3 samples per batch were tested

How to keep HT10000 from separating?

During the initial launch of the newest version HT10000-R, some customers encountered flow rate and separation issues.

The flow rate issue may have been caused by improper application, specifically:

(1) Continued high pressure applied after dispensing, causing silicone oil to be pushed out; (2) We recommend using compressed air to push the plunger, air remains between the plunger next time. Material can not be pushed out well due to the low real pushing pressure.
