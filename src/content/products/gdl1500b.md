shortDescription: "LINQCELL GDL1500B is a graphitized carbon plate that boasts impressive technical specifications, making it an excellent choice for use in PEM electrolyzers, PEMFCs, and PAFCs. This carbon paper is commonly used as a gas diffusion layer, porous transport layer and electrode, making it a versatile option for various fuel cell applications. One of the most notable features of LINQCELL GDL1500B is its low electrical resistance, with a through-plane resistance of less than 21 m&Omega;cm2. This means that it can conduct electricity with high efficiency, making it a reliable and cost-effective choice for fuel cells. Additionally, it has high thermal conductivity, allowing it to transfer heat effectively under high-temperature conditions. Another key feature of this carbon paper is its high compressibility, which enables it to reach ~1.3mm at 2MPa. This ensures excellent contact with the catalyst layer, promoting optimal performance. Moreover, its durability and low corrosion rate make it a reliable option that can last for extended periods. LINQCELL GDL1500B is a close alternative to the highly popular and discontinued Spectracarb 6060. This B version retains good strength while having significantly improved compressibility over the original GDL1500 product. It can reach ~1.3mm at 2MPa. It is not only a suitable choice for an electrode or gas diffusion layer, but it also works excellently as a Porous Transport Layer (PTL) in fuel cells. Its high compressibility and porosity allow for optimal reactant transport to the catalyst layer, which is crucial for high-performance fuel cells and electrolyzers. Applications: PEM Electrolyzers, PEMFCs and PAFCs in distributed power generators Key Features: High compressibility (>0.3mm at1.5Mpa) High thermal conductivity Low electrical resistance Applicable under high temperature High durability and low corrosion Typically thicker carbon plates such as GDL1500B are specifically suitable for Electrolyzers."
