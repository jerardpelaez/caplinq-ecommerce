shortDescription: LINQBOND DA-8030 is a single-component, silver-filled, electrically conductive die attach adhesive. It is engineered to provide exceptional thermal and electrical conductivity, ensuring efficient heat dissipation and reliable electrical connections. Its excellent adhesion properties allow for secure bonding to various substrates, such as metal and ceramic. Additionally, the modified epoxy's low-temperature curing capability minimizes thermal stress on components. LINQBOND DA-8030 is designed as a die attach for thin packages such as memory cards, CCD and CMOS assemblies. It can also be used for other applications such as consumer electronics, automotive sensors, and diodes. Cure Schedule 60 minutes at 120°C
