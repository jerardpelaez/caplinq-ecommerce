shortDescription: Hysol GR 2811 is a yellow - gold semiconductor epoxy molding compound designed for the encapsulation and protection of thin walled conductive polymer tantalum solid capacitors (POSCAP). Once molded and post-mold cured, this product provides optimum protection and reliability for these capacitor devices Hysol GR 2811 is Designed for Conductive Polymer Tantalum Solid Capacitors (POSCAP). In the world of passive components, POSCAPs are relatively new to the scene. These solid electrolytic capacitors have many advantages, but offer challenges for epoxy mold compound manufacturers. After many years of development, the GR 2811 has been developed to have excellent thin wall crack resistance - the greatest challenge of molding these devices. Furthermore, it has been optimized for automolding equipment. Hysol GR 2811 is an environmentally "green" product, meaning that it doesn't contain any bromine, antimony or phosphorus flame retardants. MG33F-0520 and MG33F-0602 dominated the space for tantalum capacitors but used halogen-containing flame retardants. This next generation epoxy mold compound replaces these older generation products.This material is designed to achieve JEDEC Level 1 requirements at 260°C reflow temperature on conductive polymer capacitors. It's fast cure time also ensures that it is compatible with the latest automold manufacturing equipment. Hysol GR 2811 meets UL 94 V-0 Flammability at 1/4 inch (6.35mm) thickness.
