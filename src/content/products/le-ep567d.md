apiId: 6651
name: OPTOLINQ LE-EP567D | Epoxy Resin for Composite Bonding
slug: le-ep567d
sku: LE-EP567D
brand: CAPLINQ
category: optically-clear-materials
subcategory: optically-clear-materials
sellingPoints:
  - High bonding strength
  - Excellent insulation
  - Good chemical resistance
shortDescription: OPTOLINQ LE-EP567D is a two-component, low viscosity epoxy with excellent handling properties, chemical resistance, and high-gloss finish. It is ideal for potting, casting, sealing, encapsulation, and adhesive applications for composite materials, such as carbon fiber repair. The hardener of LE-EP567D does not form insoluble, white solids even after being exposed to air. The cured surface remains oil-free while maintaining excellent gloss retention. Additionally, OPTOLINQ LE-EP567D offers excellent electrical insulation properties under high humidity conditions, withstands exposure to a wide range of chemicals and solvents, and complies to RoHS 2011/65/EU Directive. Applications Carbon fiber bonding and composite repairs Structural adhesive applications for metals, plastics, and composite materials Potting, casting, and encapsulation for electronics General-purpose sealing and bonding where durability and chemical resistance are needed
