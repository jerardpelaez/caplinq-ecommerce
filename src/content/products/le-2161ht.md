shortDescription: "OPTOLINQ LE-2161HT is a transparent, two-part BPA-free epoxy resin ideal for potting small components, sealing large dot matrix panels and wearable smart devices. It offers a fast curing rate, low curing temperature, and low viscosity post-mixing, and delivers exceptional electrical properties and anti-yellowing property upon curing. To meet specific color requirements, it can easily be colored and diffused using specialized dye concentrates and diffusant concentrates. OPTOLINQ LE-2161HT serves as an ideal option for various electronic applications, including smart rings, due to its ability to encapsulate delicate electronic components while maintaining transparency and providing robust electrical insulation. Key Features: High Transmittance (Anti-Yellowing Performance) BPA-Free, non-hazardous product (See SDS) Low Viscosity and Good Wettability Excellent UV Resistance (QUV Aging Performance) Highly Recommended For: Wearable Smart Devices esp Smart Rings Large Dot Matrix Panels Small Consumer Electronics Cure Schedule 24h @ 25°C 4h @ 50–60°C 2h @ 80°C"

### Anti-yellowing Performance

The following optical images of cured LE-2161HT samples (1 and 2 mm) demonstrates its anti-yellowing capability under exposure to 70 &deg;C for 24 hours at 90% RH.

QUV Aging Performance

The following optical images of cured LE-2161HT samples (1 and 2 mm) demonstrates QUV perrformance using standard QUV test: UV-A (340 nm), Irradiance: 0.76&plusmn;0.02 W/m2 nm with specimen exposed to: 8H drying, 0.25H water spray, 3.75H condensation and 50&plusmn;3 &deg;C black panel temperature.

Precautions for Use

- The usable time after A and B are mixed strongly depends on the temperature and mixing volume. Higher temperatures and larger mixing volumes lead to shorter working times. Therefore, the mixing temperature and amount should be determined based on on-site procedures.

- Use the product in a clean and well-ventilated workplace.

- Wear appropriate safety equipment before use and avoid direct contact with the body. Please read the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) carefully before using.

Storage and Handling

Store in a ventilated, dry, and clean environment. Keep away from fire and heat sources. It is strictly forbidden to store in outdoor environments. The validity time will vary depending on storage conditions. At proper storage conditions, Part A and Part B have a shelf life of 183 and 183 days, respectively. Shelf life can be extended by using cold storage.

Note: Limited quantity exceptions for LE-2161HT are 5L for passenger aircraft/rail and 60L for cargo aircraft. Under these quantities, LE-2161HT product benefit from reduced labeling requirements and need not be declared as dangerous goods.
