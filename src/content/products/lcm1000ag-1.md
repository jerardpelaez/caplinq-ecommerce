shortDescription: "LOCTITE ECCOBOND LCM 1000AG-1 is an epoxy amine based system, used in liquid compression molding and with low stress, exhibiting ultra-low-warpage during wafer-level process, and showing excellent chemical resistance and thermal stability properties. It is a non anhydride, SVHC free encapsulant for wafer level encapsulation. LOCTITE ECCOBOND LCM 1000AG-1 is a black liquid paste with high purity that is typically used on wafer level packaging and high density (less than 100um die to die) Fan Out applications. Instead of encapsulating the chip post dicing, you encapsulate the entire wafer and dice it afterwards. LOCTITE ECCOBOND LCM 1000AG-1 presents a breakthrough encapsulation material that leverages a unique anhydride-free resin platform to enable thorough protection, improved warpage control and fine gap filling for chip-on-wafer (CoW) encapsulation. LOCTITE ECCOBOND LCM 1000AG-1 is a solvent-free encapsulant that integrates exceptionally fine particle fillers (average 3 µm, upper cut 10 µm), enabling high-yield, ultra-low warpage, excellent flow properties for void-free fine-dimension filling, and fast in-mold cure times for improved UPH. In testing, LOCTITE ECCOBOND LCM 1000AG-1 exhibited the following performance benefits: Ultra-low Warpage – When evaluated on an 8” wafer, Henkel’s LCM resulted in extremely low wafer warpage of 0.39 mm after post-mold curing. Void-free Fine Gap Filling – Formulated with finer particles, LOCTITE ECCOBOND LCM 1000AG-1 quickly penetrates narrow trenches between die (FI WLP process), and is able to fill a 40 µm x 400 µm trench with no voids. High Throughput – Lab evaluation confirmed the material’s high throughput capability, with the Henkel LCM achieving an in-mold cure time of five minutes."

### LCM1000AG-1 Additional Technical Specifications




In the semiconductor market, where some argue that Moore’s Law is reaching its limit, the drive to implement extraordinary increases in functionality while diminishing – or maintaining – device dimensions is unabated. In order to achieve the desired footprints alongside cost/performance objectives, chip integration and new packaging approaches to functionality expansion are required. Fan-In Wafer-Level Packaging (FI WLP) and Fan-Out Wafer-Level Packaging (FO WLP) are two approaches that are showing promising cost efficiency and performance benefits as indicated by their market growth. According to market analyst, Yole Development, the CAGR from 2016 – 2022 for FO WLP is 31%, while FI WLP is projected to see 8% growth in the same period. For applications like data processors, mobile devices and automotive industrial systems, advancement of these technologies is good news. FO WLP is an extension of standard wafer-level packaging (WLP), but one that enables more I/O connections without having to increase the die size, allowing for a smaller package footprint with improved thermal and electrical performance. The process flow for FO WLP as compared to traditional WLP, where integrated circuits are packaged while they are still part of the wafer, is different. In FO WLP processing, the wafer is diced first and the dies are then placed onto a carrier, which is then compression molded. A redistribution layer is made on top of the entire molded area, following which solder balls are mounted onto the top.




Figure 1: FO WLP process flow (chip-first, die face-down).


Alternatively, FI WLP is a technology in which an integrated circuit is packaged at the wafer level as opposed to the fan-out approach of assembling various dies into a package after wafer dicing. The FI WLP approach is suitable for packaging dies with low input-output (I/O) counts. With this technique, a redistribution layer is used to connect copper pillars or bumps/balls on top of the die surface. Trenches are cut in between the individual dies, then filled with molding material to offer device protection prior to grinding and dicing into single units.

#### The Role and Evolution of Liquid Compression Molding for WLP Technology


For both technologies, molding or encapsulation materials are essential, but serve different purposes. In the case of FO WLP, the compression molding step is where liquid molding materials are used to coat the dies on the reconstituted wafer. The encapsulating material –or liquid compression molding (LCM) material -- is critical for both handling to enable subsequent process steps and also to protect against warpage. With thinner dies – some as thin as 50 µm– the risk of warpage and, therefore, damage is large. LCM materials help reduce or eliminate that risk. For FI WLP devices, five- or six-side protection of the dies is necessary. This is achieved by filling the cut trenches with molding material to encapsulate all four sides and the die top with protective material prior to singulation. This protective layer prevents processing damage and enhances reliability during assembly. Until recently, the LCM materials widely available on the market were very granular or powder-type materials with large fillers (25 µm – 50 µm upper cut) built on anhydride resin platforms. In many cases, the materials resulted in high wafer warpage after molding which may ultimately lead to downstream wafer handling issues. Ideally, warpage should be kept to

Fine Gap Filling Because of the fine filler particles used in the new Henkel LCM, fast flow rates and void-free trench filling and underfilling is achieved, leading to more complete coverage, protection and long-term reliability. A trench measuring 40 µm in width by 400 µm in depth is completely filled with no voids using the next generation LCM material.



#### High Throughput Process


With a five-minute in-mold cure time versus an average ten-minute cure time for anhydride-based LCM encapsulants, the Henkel’s LOCTITE ECCOBOND LCM 1000AG-1 material allows advanced packaging specialists to more than double throughput and accelerate UPH.

As FO WLP and FI WLP devices are increasingly incorporated into electronic systems to satisfy footprint/cost/performance expectations, materials like Henkel’s latest LCM innovation will be required to ensure reliability and enduring function. To learn more, visit Henkel Adhesives or contact us.
