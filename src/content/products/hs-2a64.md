shortDescription: "HumiSeal® 2A64 is a two-component polyurethane conformal coating supplied as Parts A and B for general PCB applications. HumiSeal® 2A64 offers high solids and low viscosity, making it easy to apply by brushing, dipping, or spraying. The coating fluoresces under UV light to allow quick inspection and is qualified to MIL-I-46058C, compliant with IPC-CC-830 and RoHS Directive 2011/65/EU. Mixed it has a density of about 1.07 g/cm³, viscosity of 130 cP, and solids of 55% by weight. Recommended film thickness is 25–75 µm. It is dry-to-handle in about 15 minutes and reaches full properties after curing 3 hours at 76 °C. Electrical performance is strong, with dielectric breakdown of 3,500 V, insulation resistance of 4.5×10¹⁴ Ω, and moisture insulation resistance of 4.8×10¹⁰ Ω. The product is mixed 1:1 by volume, has an 8-hour pot life, and should be allowed to settle 30 minutes after mixing. It withstands −65 °C to +125 °C in thermal shock testing and is self-extinguishing per MIL-I-46058C. Shelf life is 12 months when stored between 0–35 °C. Target applications: PCB assembly protection requiring thin, uniform coatings Automotive and industrial control modules exposed to moisture and contaminants High-reliability electronics needing strong dielectric and insulation resistance Assemblies requiring UV inspection for quality control Processes using brush, dip, or spray application"
