shortDescription: TG5500 Thermal Silicone Grease offers the highest thermal conductivity of our product line (5.5 W/mK) and a controlled bond line thickness of 23 micron @35psi, 50oC. Its viscosity and excellent thixotropy make it fit for large–scale production with dispensing, screen printing and stencil printing. It is an excellent, option for thermally demanding applications that can support a >20um BLT. TG5500 is used for applications with high power density requirements. It provides superior thermal performance with ease of use across a multitude of applications. It is a stable homogeneous mixture under room temperature with an operating temperature range of -40oC to 150oC. Please note that this thermal grease contains solvent and requires a drying step.
