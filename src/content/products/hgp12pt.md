## Frequently Asked Questions About HGP12PT (12 W/m&middot;K Ultra-Soft Thermal Putty Pad)

### What are typical applications for HGP12PT?

HGP12PT is commonly used in thermal management of sensitive electronics that require extreme softness and stress-free assembly.

- Telecommunications equipment

- GPU and data center systems

- High-power lighting (LED, LCD, optical)

- SSD thermal pads for controllers and NAND

- Wireless and RF modules

### Why choose HGP12PT over alternatives?

HGP12PT provides 12 W/m&middot;K conductivity in an ultra-soft, tacky putty format reinforced with fiberglass. It fills difficult gaps, minimizes mechanical stress, and maintains low oil bleed and low siloxane levels for contamination-sensitive assemblies.

### What is the shelf life of HGP12PT?

HGP12PT has a shelf life of 12 months when stored at 0&ndash;35&deg;C.

### How do I clean tools after applying HGP12PT?

Tools can be cleaned with electronics-safe solvents such as isopropyl alcohol to remove tacky silicone residues.

### What happens after shelf life?

After shelf life, the pad&rsquo;s softness and tackiness may shift, potentially affecting gap-fill behavior and performance consistency.

### How do I cure HGP12PT?

HGP12PT is a non-curing thermal putty pad. It is installed directly without heating or UV exposure.

### What thickness should I apply?

HGP12PT is available in 0.5&ndash;5.0 mm thickness. Select the thickness that matches your gap requirements and compression tolerance.

### How is it applied and removed?

The pad can be placed manually. Its tacky surface keeps it in position during assembly. It can be peeled off and replaced during rework as needed.

### What temperatures can it withstand?

HGP12PT operates reliably from -40&deg;C to +125&deg;C.

### Any safety or storage tips?

Store at 0&ndash;35&deg;C. Avoid dust contamination on the tacky pad surface. Handle using standard guidelines for silicone-based thermal pads.

High-Heat, High-Conformability Applications for HGP12PT

Case 1: High-Power Server VRMs and Memory Modules with Component Height Variation

Server motherboards frequently have inconsistent component heights that create uneven gap distances for VRMs, power inductors, and memory modules. Standard pads may not compress enough in low-pressure zones, leaving air pockets.

Case 5: Power Modules and IGBT Assemblies with Warpage or Bowed Substrates

Power semiconductor baseplates, especially copper or DBC surfaces, may warp during manufacturing or thermal cycling, creating uneven contact areas.

Case 3: Filling Large and Irregular Gaps in Automotive Power Control Units (PCUs)

Modern PCUs often have uneven housings and components with large mechanical tolerances. Traditional gap pads cannot fully conform to deep surface irregularities, resulting in poor contact and high thermal resistance.

**Case 4: Telecom RF Amplifiers and Baseband Units with Tight Assembly Tolerances**

5G and telecom hardware include sensitive and densely packed RF systems where slight misalignments create unpredictable air gaps.

Solstice HGP12PT Solution The putty pad accommodates complex geometries and pressure variations, ensuring consistent heat transfer from RF chipsets and PA modules. Its low-modulus and compressible nature protects fragile components while preventing hotspot formation during continuous transmission. The material remains stable under high ambient temperatures common in telecom shelters and outdoor cabinets.
