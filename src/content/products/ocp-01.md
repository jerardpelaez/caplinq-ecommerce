shortDescription: "OCP-01 Color pigment pastes are transparent liquids, used as color additives for epoxy photoelectric resins. They are fully compatible with the epoxy resin chemistry and they require only a small amount on the total formulation weight (±0.1 - 0.5%). OCP01-R, OCP01-G and OCP01-B pastes (Red, Green, Blue) have low viscosity and disperse very easily, making them cost effective due to their weight ratio. In addition to that they offer good anti-yellowing and good color fixing abilities. Reference dosage: · 0.1~0.5% of total epoxy resin formulation."
