sellingPoints:
  - Ultra low moisture absorption
  - For Flip chip BGA
  - Soon to be discontinued
shortDescription: We regret to inform you that MC723 won't be supplied from September 1st 2025 onwards. A raw material discontinuation and the limited volumes cannot justify spending resources to continue supplying this. Some close alternatives that you might want to consider are ABP 2035SCR, next to 2025D (lower modulus, successful in lid attach) and or QMI 536HT (~1 W/m-K) depending on your application description and test requirements. LOCTITE ECCOBOND MC 723 silicone adhesive is designed for lid attach in flip chip BGA applications. The ultra low moisture absorption at environmental and reliability conditions ensure high reliability performance in advanced laminate packages. LOCTITE ECCOBOND MC 723 is a non conductiveadhesive with very fast curing kinetics in conventional box oven. This adhesive can be applied on organic, metals and laminates and is typically used for ball grid arrays applications. Recommended Cure 30 minute ramp to 150°C + 30 minutes @ 150°C 30 minute ramp to 165°C + 30 minutes @ 165°C
