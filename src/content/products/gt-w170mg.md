shortDescription: "OPTOLINQ GT-W170MG is a premium white epoxy molding compound designed for the encapsulation of optical and optoelectronic semiconductor devices. It delivers exceptional photoelectric performance through outstanding light reflectance, shielding properties, and high-temperature stability. GT-W170MG is the non-green version of GT-W170. OPTOLINQ GT-W170MG complies with the stringent safety standards for voltage isolation and flammability. With its low moisture absorption and excellent anti-solderability, GT-W170MG enables devices to achieve high moisture sensitivity levels (MSL). It ensures optimal device performance and reliability in diverse applications, and is compatible with a wide range of packages, such as dual in-line packages (DIP), small outline integrated circuits (SOIC), and plastic leaded chip carriers (PLCC). Improved Version: OPTOLINQ GT-W170MG S1-1 OPTOLINQ GT-W170MG S1-1 exhibits a consistent reflectance >75% from 70nm to 1000nm. S1-1 has better adhesion to Nickel at RT compared to GT-W170MG. GT-W170MG S1-1 performs better due to its advantage of low modulus at high speed shock test and larger toughness."

### Processing Instructions



- Be sure to keep the product dry as moisture can lead to curing failures or affect the electrical integrity of compounds.

- Before use, thaw GT-W170MG for 16–24 hours at 20–25 °C with the package sealed. Keep the packaging unopened to prevent moisture contamination.




### Storage and Handling


To ensure the integrity of OPTOLINQ GT-W170MG, keep it away from oxidizing materials. Avoid exposure to heat sources like molding dies and lead-frame preheating panels, as prolonged heat exposure can lead to the degradation of the molding compound. Transport the product at or below 10°C for best results. For extended storage, maintain a cold environment, ideally at 5 °C or lower. Under proper conditions, the shelf life of the product is 9 months from the manufacturing date. The pot life is 72 hours when unpacked at room temperature after removal from the cold room, including thawing time.




Please note that the provided information is based on available data and typical conditions. For specific applications and detailed test results, refer to the actual test data and conduct appropriate certifications.
