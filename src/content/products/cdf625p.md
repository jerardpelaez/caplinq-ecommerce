shortDescription: LOCTITE® ABLESTIK CDF 625P silver filled, die attach adhesive film is the most universal film, compatible with pre-cut wafer lamination equipment, recommended for large die applications. It is suitable for bonding integrated circuits and components with low warpage and good adhesion (>5MPA) on laminates and metal finishes. Furthermore, it has the lowest total cost of ownership and covers a wide die size range up to 10x10mm. LOCTITE® ABLESTIK CDF 625P has a broad application space with controlled 25um bondline and a low modulus that is very close to Ablestik 8322A (2000 MPa @ RT, 40 MPa @ 250C.). This conductive die attach film can be effectively used for other applications and can also be a potentially replacement for QMI519.

### How is CDF 625P packaged and "rolled?


Henkel has worked with its suppliers to improve the Conductive Die Attach Film (cDAF) product line by developing an edge tape layer to mitigate the occurrence of impression marks.
Two “Edge Tapes” are applied acting like a shim to reduce the contact pressure on the adhesive circles and potential impression marks on the roll. As these 2 “Edge Tapes” are applied outside of the functional CDF 625P adhesive circle, there’s no impact on Fit, Form, or Function! This makes this a major improvement without any effect to your current process.
