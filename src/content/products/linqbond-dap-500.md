## Product Description

LinQBond DAP-500 is a silver-filled epoxy die attach paste formulated for power semiconductor packaging applications where both high thermal and electrical conductivity at the die-to-substrate interface are critical. Loaded with 80 wt% silver flake filler, the DAP-500 achieves a cured thermal conductivity of 25 W/mK and an electrical resistivity below 5.0 x 10^-4 Ohm*cm, providing an uninterrupted thermal and electrical pathway from the die backside to the leadframe or substrate.

The DAP-500 features a carefully engineered thixotropic rheology that allows consistent dispensing via needle or jet dispensing equipment, producing well-defined dot or pattern deposits with minimal tailing or satellite formation. Its controlled flow behavior during the cure cycle ensures the paste wets the die backside completely while maintaining the die in position, resulting in void-free bond lines with high die shear strength exceeding 20 MPa at 260 °C.

Designed for automotive-grade reliability, the DAP-500 passes rigorous qualification testing including 1000 cycles of temperature cycling (-65 to 150 °C), 1000 hours of high-temperature storage at 175 °C, and MSL 1 preconditioning followed by 3x 260 °C reflow. It is compatible with copper, silver, gold, and nickel-plated leadframe surfaces and is supplied in syringes or jars with a 6-month shelf life when stored at -40 °C.

## Key Features

- 80 wt% silver filler for maximum thermal and electrical conductivity
- 25 W/mK thermal conductivity in the cured state
- Excellent dispensability with needle and jet dispensing systems
- Die shear strength >20 MPa at 260 °C
- Void-free bonding with controlled rheology
- Automotive-grade reliability (AEC-Q100 compatible)
- Compatible with Cu, Ag, Au, and Ni-plated surfaces

## Applications

LinQBond DAP-500 is used as the primary die attach material for power discrete devices (MOSFETs, IGBTs, diodes), power modules, and high-power LED packages where efficient heat removal from the die is paramount. It is the preferred choice for automotive-grade power devices used in motor drives, on-board chargers, and DC-DC converters in electric and hybrid vehicles. The DAP-500 is also used in RF power amplifier packaging and high-reliability industrial power supply assemblies where consistent electrical grounding and thermal dissipation at the die level are required.
