shortDescription: "OPTOLINQ TMC-8040 is a high-performance optically clear epoxy developed for high reliability white chip monochrome LED applications. This anhydride cured, monocomponent BisA and Cycloaliphatic combination achieves superior adhesion performance and great transmittance. Its stability at high temperature aids towards a good package performance and long life. It works very similar, if better than XX-600H product types. TMC-8040 is able to offer medium anti-blue-light decay stability. It maintains high blue-wavelength transmittance with minimal yellowing, offers strong moisture resistance, and has shown robust performance in TCT, PCT, and IR-reflow with low discoloration. It is engineered to meet JEDEC MSL 3 / 2A requirements for reliable assembly. OPTOLINQ TMC-8040 is developed based on TMC-8020T with improved moisture resistance and anti-blue decay properties. Check the Reliability Test Comparison between TMC-8040 and TMC-8020T. Typical Applications Low-Power LED & Emitters Pulse Oximeter Sensors Ambient Light Sensors IR and Near-IR Sensors Data transmission and industrial fibers. Comparable With: XX-600"

TMC-8040 Transmittance Data

TMC-8040 exhibits high baseline optical transmission from 400nm to 1000nm - high enough for applications requiring optical clarity

 
 TMC-8040 V.S. TC-8020 Reliability Tests

Both TMC-8020 and TMC-8040 pass the reflow tests and double 85 tests, showing no dead lights and no color shift in substrates. TMC-8040 has improved moisture-resistance property, compared with TMC-8020 series and better performance in pressure cooking test (PCT) and blue decay test. TMC-8040 is suitable for surface mount packages, requiring MSL3 & 2A.
