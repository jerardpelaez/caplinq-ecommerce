### How to Enhance NanoClear Durability


NanoClear is very chemical and abrasion-resistant, but coarse under-wipe papers designed for uncoated stencils can scratch the coating of the foil over an extended period of time.


• Softer papers are more effective at cleaning stencils and preserving the thin coating.


• Extending the frequency of under-wiping helps limit the abrasion, and is a benefit that NanoClear affords its users.


• Solvent wipe provides lubrication to decrease the abrasion of the wiper textile.


• Higher wiper pressures will increase the abrasion of the wiper textile.


• pH neutral, or pH9 will attack both wipe-on and spray-on coatings.


• Any signs of wear will first be visible at the end of the under-wipe stroke, where flux gets left behind on the stencil.
