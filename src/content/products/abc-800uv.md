shortDescription: ABChimie&reg; 800UV is a transparent urethane acrylate conformal coating designed to provide mechanical and environmental protection to electronic components and assemblies. It features dual-cure technology (UV and humidity), which allows for the complete crosslinking through the entire PCB, even in areas that may be covered by shadow. The coating also allows the PCB to be soldered through without producing toxic gases. ABChimie 800UV exhibits an increased viscosity formulation (>500cP), which makes it ideal for conformal coating applied through the selective coating method. The increased viscosity also improves the edge coverage of the PCB. The coating cures rapidly under UV light, has low VOCs, and can be applied to high-speed manufacturing processes to increase productivity. ABChimmie 800UV is in full compliance with REACH and RoHS regulations, and is also going through UL qualification.

- Consumer electronics (e.g., smart devices, wearables)

- Other high-reliability electronic assemblies

### Why choose ABChimie&reg; 800 UV?

ABChimie&reg; 800 UV delivers rapid UV curing, excellent electrical insulation, optical transparency, and strong adhesion to flexible substrates. It supports high-throughput manufacturing while providing durable protection for sensitive components. 800 is a medium viscosity coating.

### What is the shelf life of ABChimie&reg; 800 UV?

ABChimie&reg; 800 UV has a shelf life of 12 months when stored at 5&ndash;30&deg;C in tightly sealed containers. Prior to use, allow the product to equilibrate for 24 hours at 18&ndash;32&deg;C for optimal performance.

### What happens after the shelf life?

Using ABChimie&reg; 800 past its shelf life may alter viscosity, affecting uniformity and application performance. Always use an in-date product for reliable results.

### What is the recommended curing method for ABChimie&reg; 800 UV?

ABChimie&reg; 800 UV is UV-curable and should be cured with a mercury lamp. The minimum UVA dose is 1000 mJ/cm&sup2; for a 100 &mu;m thickness. The mercury lamp-curable version is ABChimie&reg; 800 UV. Higher UVA doses do not negatively affect final properties.

### What is the recommended thickness for ABChimie&reg; 800 UV?

ABChimie&reg; 800 UV coating can be applied by brush, spray, or selective coating. The recommended thickness 30-300 microns.

### Should I control the application environment?

ABChimie&reg; 800 UV should be applied at a minimum temperature of 16&deg;C and a minimum relative humidity of 50% are recommended for coating application. The relative humidity of at least 50% is recommended for the second ABchimie TDS ABchimie 800UV and UV LED polymerization mechanism. Before applying, the printed circuit board must be clean, dry, and free of moisture. A stage in an oven at 80 &deg;C for 4 hours is usually sufficient.

### Can I adjust the viscosity?

ABChimie&reg; 800 UV can be customized for variable viscosities. Contact our team for guidance.

## Main Advantages of ABChimie 800 UV

dual cure technology

ABchimie&reg; 800 UV cures through a dual mechanism: UV exposure initiates rapid surface curing, while moisture ensures complete curing throughout the coating. This combination provides a uniform, durable protective layer with optimal adhesion and performance.

improved edge coverage

For improved edge coverage, ABChimie&reg; 800 UV features a carefully balanced viscosity that allows the material to flow evenly across PCB surfaces and around sharp edges. This controlled flow minimizes thinning at corners and edges, resulting in a more uniform coating thickness and consistent coverage across complex board geometries.

ability to solder

ABchimie&reg; 800 UV can be soldered through without generating highly toxic gases, ensuring safe processing. The coating maintains its integrity during soldering, allowing reliable connections while protecting the underlying components.

excellent adhesion in harsh environments

Application tips

## How to Optimise for the Best Results

 

pcb preparation

PCBs must be completely dry and thoroughly clean, with no dust, grease, wax, or other contaminants. Coating adhesion depends directly on the quality of the substrate. All flux residues must be fully removed, as they can become corrosive and lead to circuit malfunctions.

How to clean the pcb

For cleaning equipment or removing uncured ABchimie 800 UV or UV LED varnish, we recommend using SND or ABclean solvent.

uv recommendation

It is essential to use the correct UV equipment (UV or LED) and follow the recommended settings to achieve the optimal properties of the cured conformal coating. These parameters influence both the coating&rsquo;s reactivity and surface quality. ABchimie 800 UV and UV LED cure through UV exposure, with moisture contributing to a secondary curing mechanism.

Curing Mechanism: UV light creates the first cure, and after 7 days the moisture from the environment completes the curing process.

double-curing mechanism

### How does Moisture Cure Work?

During UV curing, exposure to UV light activates the photoinitiators in the conformal coating, triggering rapid polymerization of the resin. This results in an immediate surface cure and fast development of handling strength. UV curing provides precise, on-demand curing in exposed areas, enabling high-throughput processing while maintaining coating uniformity. ABchimie 800 UV and ABchimie 800 UV LED use the same dual curing mechanism to ensure complete curing, including in shadowed or hard-to-reach areas. Initial curing is achieved by UV exposure, while a secondary moisture-activated cure completes the process at ambient temperature. For full curing in shaded areas, a minimum relative humidity of 50% is required for at least 7 days. Alternative to Mercury Lamp Curing of ABChimie 800 UV

ABChimie 800 UV is also available in the LED lamp version, which cures with an LED lamp.
