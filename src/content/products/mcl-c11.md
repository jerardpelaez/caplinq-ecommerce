shortDescription: CHEMLINQ MCL-C11 is a mold cleaning compound (tablet) composed of melamine resin, silica filler, and other additives. It is specifically formulated to remove epoxy molding compound residues and stains from metal mold dies. MCL-C11 has high cohesive strength and optimized rheological properties. It effectively restores mold surface integrity, prolongs tooling lifespan, and significantly reduces mold cleaning cycle times, minimizing production downtime. This compression grade product is well-suited for cleaning mold dies in semiconductor packaging, where clean surfaces are essential for consistent quality and yield. MCL-C11 is designed for the cleaning of mold stains deposited during EMC molding for encapsulation of leadframe products like capacitors, resistors or semiconductor IC chips. It exhibits excellent cleaning properties and has high adhesive strength since it is based on a melamine resin system which helps capture the stains and clean in fewer shots. It is also compatible with other CHEMLINQ rubber cleaning sheets for better cleaning performance. CHEMLINQ MCL-C11 comes in a variety of Tablets/Pellets sizes that can be laid over the mold equipment. Contact us for pellet sizes and weight.
