shortDescription: RCS 400 Rubber cleaning sheets are carcinogen free materials that are safe to handle and use compared to other rubber cleaning versions. They are used to eliminate pollutants and stains formed on the mold surface and perform well in a wide range of molds. They require a mold temperature of 165 - 200°C and have a curing time of about 300-600 seconds depending on your cleaning conditions. These sheets perform almost similar to other versions while having the advantage of being safe and easy to use, something that assists in reducing processing time. RCS 400 sheets have good flow characteristics which enable them to clean mold corners and thin gate areas easily. Unlike melamine compound cleaners, RCS cleaning sheets can clean the air ventilation areas without causing mold abrasion or corrosion. At the same time there's no need for dummy lead frame or preheating and they need 3-5 shots to be effective, something that reduces cleaning time and leads to improved production time and productivity. For a safe and clean process we advise a combination of RCS 400 with WS300 wax conditioning sheets. RCS 400 Rubber cleaning sheets are suited for IC, Semiconductors and Discrete molding processes and have relatively low to medium viscosity. Are you molding LED and need higher viscosity?
