## Product Description

LinQBond DAF-300 is a high-performance die attach film engineered for advanced semiconductor packaging applications, including multi-die stacking, fan-out wafer-level packaging, and 3D IC integration. The DAF-300 is a B-stage epoxy-based adhesive film that provides void-free bonding at controlled bond line thicknesses, enabling the tight dimensional control required by modern high-density package architectures.

Supplied on a dicing tape carrier, the DAF-300 is laminated onto the wafer backside before the dicing process, allowing singulation and die attach in a seamless workflow. During the thermal compression bonding step, the film flows to fill surface topography and eliminate voids, then cures to form a rigid thermoset adhesive with a glass transition temperature of 175 °C. The result is a reliable mechanical and thermal bond between the die and substrate or between stacked dies.

The DAF-300 exhibits low moisture absorption (<0.5% at 85 °C/85% RH), enabling it to pass JEDEC Moisture Sensitivity Level 1 (MSL 1) reflow testing without delamination or popcorn cracking. Its high die shear strength of >15 MPa at 260 °C ensures package integrity through lead-free reflow soldering and subsequent reliability testing. The DAF-300 is compatible with both wire bond and flip-chip packaging platforms.

## Key Features

- Void-free bonding for multi-die stacking and 3D IC packaging
- Available in 10 to 50 µm thicknesses for precise bond line control
- High die shear strength (>15 MPa at 260 °C)
- JEDEC MSL 1 moisture resistance capability
- High Tg (175 °C) for lead-free reflow compatibility
- Compatible with wafer backside lamination and dicing workflows
- Suitable for both wire bond and flip-chip architectures

## Applications

LinQBond DAF-300 is designed for use in high-volume semiconductor packaging lines for memory (DRAM, NAND Flash) die stacking, system-in-package (SiP) assemblies, and advanced logic packaging. It is the material of choice for multi-die stack packages where precise film thickness and void-free performance at each layer are critical. The DAF-300 is also used in MEMS packaging and image sensor assembly where thin, uniform die attach layers with low stress are required to preserve device performance.
