## Frequently Asked Questions About HumiSeal® UV50LV



### What are typical applications for HumiSeal® UV50LV?


HumiSeal® UV50LV is a versatile, high-performance UV curable conformal coating specifically formulated for film coater-type selective coating equipment. It's widely used for protecting printed circuit board assemblies (PCBs) across a broad range of industries, including:



- Military and aerospace electronics (e.g., avionics, control modules)

- Industrial electronics (e.g., motor drives, sensors)

- Automotive electronics (e.g., control units, electronic modules)

- Consumer electronics (e.g., communication devices, household electronics)




Its excellent chemical resistance, high flexibility, and moisture resistance make it ideal for harsh environments and mission-critical applications where fast processing and reliable protection are essential. Its lower viscosity is key for specific selective coating machinery.




### Why choose HumiSeal® UV50LV over other conformal coatings?


HumiSeal® UV50LV is a single-component, low viscosity, high-solids, acrylated polyurethane formulation that provides excellent chemical and environmental resistance. It offers rapid tack-free curing under UV light, significantly increasing efficiency of production cycles. Its unique secondary moisture cure mechanism ensures full curing of any unexposed "shadow areas" of the coating within 7 days at ambient conditions. The coating fluoresces under UV light to enable easy inspection of coverage and uniformity. It is UL recognized (UL File Number E105698). UV50LV is formulated specifically for film coater-type selective coating equipment, offering efficiency for high-volume production processes and improved flexibility for better thermal cycling performance.






### What is the shelf life of HumiSeal® UV50LV?


HumiSeal® UV50LV has a shelf life of 12 months from the date of manufacture when stored sealed in tightly closed opaque containers at 0 to 25°C, away from excessive heat and direct sunlight or full spectrum fluorescent lighting. Before use, allow the product to equilibrate for 24 hours at room temperature for optimal application performance. As UV50LV is a moisture curing material, care should be taken to protect process vessels and partial containers from moisture by purging with a dry, inert gas (e.g., dry air, nitrogen, or argon) before closure.




### How should I clean tools after applying HumiSeal® UV50LV?


To flush equipment and clean uncured HumiSeal® UV50LV, non-alcohol based solvents should be used. HumiSeal® Thinner 521 is recommended. For coating removal during rework, HumiSeal® UV50LV is a highly cross-linked UV cured coating and is more difficult to remove than traditional coatings. Thermal displacement, mechanical abrasion and, where available, HumiSeal® Stripper 1100 are suitable options for rework of HumiSeal® UV50LV.






### What happens to HumiSeal® UV50LV after its shelf life?


After the shelf life, viscosity and curing characteristics may degrade, potentially leading to uneven coating, reduced protective performance, or improper curing. Use of expired material is not recommended as it may compromise coating quality. Given its photosensitive and moisture-curing nature, proper storage is crucial to maintaining product integrity.




### How does HumiSeal® UV50LV cure, and why do curing times vary?


HumiSeal® UV50LV is a dual-cure coating. The primary cure is achieved rapidly through exposure to UV light, making the coating tack-free almost instantly. The required UV dose and irradiance will depend on the specific UV system. A secondary moisture cure mechanism is designed to fully cure any unexposed "shadow areas" within 7 days at ambient conditions. Due to variations in curing equipment and process conditions, it is strongly recommended to consult us for technical support.






### What is the recommended thickness for HumiSeal® UV50LV?


The recommended coating thickness for HumiSeal® UV50LV is 25 to 125 microns (1-5 mils) to ensure optimal protection without compromising flexibility or electrical performance. The actual thickness will vary based on application equipment and process settings.




### What are the differences between application methods for HumiSeal® UV50LV?


HumiSeal® UV50LV is formulated specifically for film coater-type selective coating equipment. When applying, the source air must be dry (a dry inert gas is highly recommended) to prevent premature curing of the secondary cure mechanism. Hand spraying or brushing may not be suitable due to the material's specific low-viscosity formulation for automated selective coating.






### What is the maximum operating temperature for HumiSeal® UV50LV?


HumiSeal® UV50LV has improved performal in thermal cycling tests (typically -40℃ to 85℃). Continuous operation at higher temperatures is generally the upper limit, as prolonged exposure to higher temperatures may degrade coating integrity.




### What safety precautions should I take when using HumiSeal® UV50LV?


Use in well-ventilated areas and avoid inhalation of vapors or spray. Prevent skin and eye contact by wearing appropriate protective equipment, including opaque gloves and UV-protective eyewear due to its photosensitive nature. The product contains no VOCs or solvents. Consult the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for detailed handling, storage, and disposal instructions. Ensure that product containers are tightly closed and opaque, and purge partial containers with dry inert gas to prevent premature polymerization.






### How can I ensure proper application of HumiSeal® UV50LV?


HumiSeal® UV50LV fluoresces brightly under UV light, allowing for quick and easy visual inspection of coating coverage and uniformity. This feature is critical for ensuring proper application and quality control in high-reliability electronics manufacturing, making it simple to identify any missed areas or defects.




### How does HumiSeal® UV50LV perform in harsh environments?


HumiSeal® UV50LV provides excellent protection against moisture, chemicals, salt spray, and fungus (passes ASTM G21). Its highly cross-linked UV-cured film, combined with the secondary moisture cure, ensures robust performance and maintains integrity in humid, corrosive, and mechanically stressful environments. The high flexibility of the cured film provides improved thermal cycling performance, making it highly suitable for military, aerospace, automotive, and industrial applications.
