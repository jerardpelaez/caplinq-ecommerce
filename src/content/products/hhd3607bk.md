shortDescription: LOCTITE HHD 3607BK is a reactive hot-melt adhesive based on reactive polyurethane prepolymers. This moisture curable product is formulated with a viscosity suitable for robotic jetting applications along with a suitable open time for automatic assembly line processing. LOCTITE HHD 3607BK exhibits good initial strength that is realised immediately after the materiaL solidifies in the bondline. LOCTITE HHD 3607BK material exhibits superior toughness, works great with glass surfaces and will not remelt when fully cured. Cure schedule LOCTITE HHD 3607BK cures exclusively by moisture and gains its final strength in 1 to 7 days. This material, however, exhibits high handling strength instantly after bonding.

### Curing parameters



- Open Time, minutes ≥2

- Preheating Schedule 20 to 30 mins @ 110°C

- Application Temperature, °C 100 to 120




LOCTITE HHD 3607BK cures exclusively by moisture and gains its final strength in 1 to 7 days. This material, however, exhibits high handling strength instantly after bonding.


Curing is a chemical reaction depending on the following parameters:



- Humidity in the rooms of application and storage

- Moisture content on the substrates

- Permeability of the substrates to be bonded

- Application volume / layer of the adhesive film






### How can I clean my equipment after using HHD 3607BK?


For HHD 3607BK we would recommend TECHNOMELT PUR CLEANER 2 or any equivalent cleaning agent. Typically we suggest to:



- Run the equipment with at least ~5ml of this PUR CLEANER 2 out of the bleed port on the side,

- Close the bleed port

- Run another 1-2ml out of the needle.




This way there’s no need to fully breakdown the pump if running the same product (like HHD 3607BK) all the time as long as you can make sure that about 6-7ml total bleed occurs. This is generally a better option than IPA which is mainly used for cleaning equipment in use with varying adhesives but please note that this TECHNOMELT PUR CLEANER 2 is only available in 20kg package which won’t be practical for lab work.


You can also take a look at LOCTITE MSC 01, a softer IPA solder paste cleaner that could be use as an alternative or at LOCTITE SF 7360 which comes in handy 500ml bottles and it is a multi-purpose cleaner for epoxy adhesive residues and conductive/non conductive adhesives.


While we cannot guarantee those 2 will work we will be happy to support you with any questions that might occur.


### PUR cleaners


PUR Cleaners are higher viscosity PUR based liquids which do not cure and fill the equipment when not in use. Reactive hot melts like 3607BK will cure in the system when not in use, so they have to be purged out when you stop.


It is likely that any PUR cleaner without cure can do this as long as you purge the cleaner, e.g. replace the cleaner with fresh 3607BK when you start dispensing again.
