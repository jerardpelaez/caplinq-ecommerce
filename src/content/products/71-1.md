shortDescription: We regret to inform you that after the discontinuation of 71-X series in EU in March 2020 (by REACH/ECHA health and safety related handling restrictions per May 2020 in EU), there is now also a GLOBAL 71-X discontinuation due to a specific Raw Material discontinuation. Effective from the middle of September 2021. Looking for a 71-1 alternative? Some close, but not drop in, solutions are LOCTITE ABLESTIK 8700E, LOCTITE ABLESTIK QMI529HT-LV, LOCTITE ABLESTIK 8064 and LOCTITE ABLESTIK 8068TB. There's also LOCTITE ABLESTIK 8700K for a Non Conductive option. Check the alternative product table in the Additional information section and contact us for a quotation or for further advice. LOCTITE ABLESTIK 71-1 die attach adhesive is designed for microelectronic and semiconductor packaging applications. It is formulated to provide high bond strength at ambient and elevated temperatures.

These are close alternatives that we have found to work in the same applications that 71-1 used to work. Even though they have a range of different chemistries they have been tried from 71-1 users and some of them like 8600/8700, JM7000 have proven to be almost drop in solutions with some fluctuations in Thermal conductivity


The peak temperatures for most of these products are very similar to 71-1 so most ovens should be able to handle them. Additionally there are single cure options that are easier to work with and process than the 71-1 Polyimide chemistry.

Some insight:


LOCTITE ABLESTIK 84-1LMISR4 is a product was born 30+ years ago (maybe more) by Ablestik and is still the top sales product of Henkel Electronics material by far. It provides an array of flexibilities from multiple Henkel factories, production frequencies to syringe sizes.


LOCTITE ABLESTIK QMI519 is also a volume runner, a little pricey but its robust Hybrid BMI/ Acrylate properties can enable upgraded performance device.


LOCTITE ABLESTIK JM7000 is a cyanate ester used almost exclusively for hermetic packaging so it can, in principle, work great as a replacement for 71-1.
