shortDescription: LOCTITE ECCOBOND LUX AA50T die attach adhesive is formulated to enhance productivity in the assembly of optical, fiber optic and optoelectronic devices. This adhesive cures in seconds when exposed to the appropriate intensity of visible (blue) or UV light. It also contains a secondary thermal cure mechanism for applications with shadowed areas. LOCTITE ECCOBOND LUX AA50T is a high viscosity acrylate that cures fast with UV or visible light. It offers good mechanical stability and low shrinkage. This white opaque die attach material is typically used for optoelectronics devices, LED mounting, laser diode packaging, fiber pigtailing and transceiver active alignment and potting. UV Cure UV or visible light Secondary Thermal Cure 1 hour @ 100°C
