shortDescription: LOCTITE ABLESTIK NCA 2280 dual cure adhesive is designed for use in the assembly of temperature sensitive electronic components. ABLESTIK NCA 2280 has been formulated to a high viscosity and thixotropy to enable higher aspect ratios of dispensed adhesive, thus allowing for easier adjustments for the final assembly. LOCTITE ABLESTIK NCA 2280 is black in color to prevent light penetration into the final assembled device. This product is formulated to temporarily cure when exposed to UV light, followed with a secondary thermal cure at low temperature. Temporarily curing the material allows for any necessary adjustments to the final device configuration.

Recommended Heat Cure Schedule



- 30 minutes @ 80°C




Recommended UV Cure



 High pressure mercury lamp:



- UV Wavelength, nm: 220-380

- Light Intensity, mW/cm²: 100

- Exposure Time, seconds: 2







Directions for Use



- Complete cleaning of the substrates should be performed to remove contamination such as oxide layers, dust, moisture, salt and oils which can cause poor adhesion or corrosion in a bonded part.

- Apply adhesive to all surfaces to be bonded and join together.
