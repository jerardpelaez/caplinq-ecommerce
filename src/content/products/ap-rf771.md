shortDescription: KESTER RF771 is a medium-viscosity, water-soluble flux designed for electronic component rework and repair applications. RF771 has a gel-like consistency and is easily applied by syringe dispensing. RF771 can be precisely dispensed onto a specific area that needs flux. After being dispensed, RF771 stays in place until soldering occurs. Traditional problems experienced with controlling the application of water-soluble liquid fluxes are eliminated. RF771 has excellent performance in applications that require a flux having good thermal stability such as surface mount component repair. RF771 is the ideal choice for QFP or BGA semi-automated rework operations. In addition, RF771 is well suited for use with through-hole repair operations where solder fountain or controlled solder reservoir is being used for selective component removal and repair. Residues that remain on surfaces after soldering are easily removed with hot water. KESTER RF771 can be used in combination with Kester water-soluble cored wire solders and water-soluble solder pastes, as well as water-soluble liquid fluxes, to provide the complete water-soluble soldering connection.
