shortDescription: "LINQBOND NCA-9121 is a one-component, B-stageable, modified epoxy adhesive engineered for demanding semiconductor and microelectronic packaging applications. It offers a unique combination of performance and processing benefits. LINQBOND NCA-9121 is available in two colors: white and black. Recommended Curing Conditions B-Stage Cure: Ramp from room temperature to 110℃ in 30mins + soak for 30mins @ 110 °C. Final Cure: Ramp from room temperature to 185℃ in 30mins + soak for 90mins @ 185 °C. Product Key Features Optimized for backside wafer applications B-stageable — enables tack-free handling after oven pre-cure, facilitating automated or manual die placement. Excellent adhesion — forms strong bonds to a wide range of substrates, including diverse die surfaces and silver-plated leadframes. Compatible with stencil or screen printing and cures with placement pressure. Key Applications Backside wafer applications High-density packaging environments requiring reliable adhesion and electrical insulation."
