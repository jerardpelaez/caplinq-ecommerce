shortDescription: "PA-1510-005 is a UV-curable, solvent-free polyacrylate process material. With its advanced polyacrylate technology, this ink strikes a perfect balance between flexibility and durability. The material has the properties that provides heat, insulation, impact resistance which can offer temporary protection for any critical components midway to the assembly line process. PA-1510-005 which rapidly cures under UV light, exhibits exceptional filling property wherein its low viscosity allows precise pattern printing application. Another feature of this process materials is the solubility after the heat process which enables it to dissolve and still become fully integrated into the medium. Industry Applications: Microelectronics Mechanical Systems (MEMS) | Assembly Line Component Protection"
