sellingPoints:
  - Enhanced adhesion
  - Rigid, low stress seal
  - High purity
shortDescription: LOCTITE ECCOBOND FP4547 liquid epoxy underfill is designed to provide enhanced adhesion to integrated circuit passivation materials. This material is formulated to quickly underfill devices at 90 to 120°C substrate temperature, with as little as a 2 to 3 mil gap. When fully cured, the material forms a rigid, low stress seal that dissipates stress on solder joints and extends thermal cycling performance. LOCTITE ECCOBOND FP4547 also exhibits low moisture absorption for improved JEDEC performance. Recommended Cure Schedule 30 minutes @ 165°C
