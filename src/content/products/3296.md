shortDescription: LOCTITE® 3296 is a dual-cure adhesive specifically developed for Automotive ADAS Optical Modules, including critical bonding applications like lens barrel-to-housing and lens housing-to-circuit board assemblies. This advanced adhesive is engineered for high-performance environments where precise alignment and long-term stability are essential. With a fast UV cure that can achieve primary bonding in as little as 3 seconds under adequate UV exposure, LOCTITE® 3296 significantly speeds up production cycles, reducing downtime and increasing throughput. Its exceptional thermal stability is highlighted by a Glass Transition Temperature (Tg) of 189°C, making it ideal for components exposed to intense heat. Its low Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE) of 22.1 ppm/°C (between 25-125°C) and minimal shrinkage of 0.3% ensure that it maintains a strong, reliable bond even in demanding thermal conditions, minimizing the risk of component stress or misalignment over time. Mechanically, LOCTITE® 3296 provides robust support with a Shore D hardness of 94 and an E-Modulus of 10,900 MPa at 25°C, offering excellent stiffness and durability for critical assemblies. This makes it particularly suited for optical modules where precise bonding is crucial for long-term optical clarity and alignment. LOCTITE® 3296 is well-suited for automated production environments, exhibiting low-viscosity behavior that ensures smooth, consistent dispensing. It is also designed to work without SVHCs and antimony, aligning with industry demands for environmentally responsible manufacturing processes.
