shortDescription: LINQTAPE™ DCT-PVC80NUV is a polymerized vinyl chloride tape used in the dicing process. It provides an excellent balance of electrical, mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties. Its strong adhesion ensures the wafer remains secure during different manufacturing processes like die-cutting. The security the tape provides prevents wafer damage, whiskers, soaking and allows for cleaner cuts. LINQTAPE™ DCT-PVC80NUV is a translucent 80µm film, with a one-sided 10µm acrylic adhesive layer, and backed with a PET liner. It is ideal for small chips. This product can be customized according to the customer's needs. Key Features Strong adhesion to prevent wafer damage Can be used with uneven surfaces Antistatic High Transparency High and evenly distributed elasticity High heat tolerance (60 °C for a few minutes) Application Ideas Die -cutting Great for small silicon wafers
