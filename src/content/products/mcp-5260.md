### How to use MCP-5260:


To begin, the surface of the substrate should always be clean, dry, and contaminant free. If the substrate is not prepared correctly, failure can occur. For the electrostatic fluidized bed application, the air pressure is adjusted to fluidize the powder in the tank. Then the powder is charged, and the part is rotated on a screw conveyance belt until it reaches the required coating thickness. Any undesired powder can be brushed off, then the part moves to the oven for curing. For the hotbed coating/thermal spraying application, the part is preheated to 180-200 °C, then submerged into the powder bed. After 3-5 seconds it is removed, excess powder shaked off, and redipped. This process is repeated until desired coating thickness is achieved. Finally, the part is cured in an oven.




Industrial motors include power tools, home appliances and industrial motors. In automotive, motors are used for enclosures, windshield wipers, seat adjusters, window lifts, and fuel pumps, quality cars can have up to 130 motors. An electric motor is made by wrapping an electric current around a magnetic core, and these two must be insulated from each other. This can be done by using insulating epoxy coating powder. Epoxy coating powders are widely used due to the advantages of efficiency and reliability. Check our Application Page Slot Insulation for more details.


 



## Insulation Epoxy Coating Powder Requirements


### Great Performance



- Excellent edge coverage

- High cut-through resistance temperature (minimum 300°C)

- High service temperatures and insulation class

- Capability to provide a range of thermal conductivities




### Great Manufacturing Productivity



- High build rate enables faster coating line speed

- Outstanding adhesion to metal and plastics

- Low thickness required to achieve max performance

- Both induction and oven cure chemistries










 
  High Edge Coverage





Epoxy coating powders are likely to be cut by copper wire at the edges. Minimum 300-400um coating thickness and 40% edge coverage ratio are required. MCP-5260 has an edge coverage of 45%.






 
  Even, Consistent Distribution




MCP-5260 provides an even, consistent distribution of coating. This improves the motor balance, which in turn increases efficiency and decreases vibration and noise.






 
  Low Pick Up Temperature





Lower temperature and faster cure plus great electrostatic pickup increase productivity and save money, MCP-5260 has a melting temperature of 98-110°C, which allows quick pick up.







Storage


Store in a ventilated, dry, and clean environment below 25°C. Keep away from fire and heat sources. It is strictly forbidden to store in outdoor environments. The product has a shelf life of 6 months under proper storage conditions.


Precautions



- Avoid long-term skin contact. Powder that touched the skin should be rinsed off quickly.

- During operation, dust-proof masks should be used to avoid inhalation.

- Keep the oven temperature stable, so as not to affect the color and quality of the coating due to excessive temperature deviation.

- The concentration of dust should be controlled within a safe range to avoid malfunctioning the coating equipment.
