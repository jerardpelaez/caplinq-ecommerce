shortDescription: Hysol MG52F is a fast curing, high productivity molding compound, designed for high volume encapsulation of surface mount devices. MG52F is applicable for devices having chip dimensions up to 1 centimeter (400 mils) square. Various versions are available including MG52F-99B NXP which is designed to provide greatly improved moisture performance after preconditioning. It can be applied using both conventional and automold equipment. Hysol MG52F was designed for and passed qualification testing on SOIC, PLCC, QFP, PDIP, 28, 48 and 56 pin TSSOP packages and has been used in production for more than 20 years. These packages had a copper leadframe with palladium plating. This material is designed to achieve JEDEC Level 1 requirements at 260°C reflow temperature on copper based, palladium-plated leadframes. Hysol MG52F meets UL 94 V-0 Flammability at 1/8 inch (3.18mm) thickness. Hysol MG52F offers high adhesion to a wide range of substrates including Nickel and Palladium, low stress, a large operating window and molds with very low wire sweep.
