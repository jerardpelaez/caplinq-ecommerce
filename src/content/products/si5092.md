shortDescription: LOCTITE® SI 5092™ is used for potting, coating and sealing of various automotive, electronic, military and industrial components. It is highly flexible and enhances the load bearing and shock absorbing characteristics of the bond area. LOCTITE® SI 5092™ is a non corrosive, single component alkoxy silicone that requires no mixing and can cure with Ultraviolet light. Moisture is utilized as a secondary cure to cure shadowed areas. This self-leveling product offers uniform cavity fills.

Typical curing performance


Normal processing conditions will include exposure to sufficient UV light irradiance to effectively cure the material. Surface and/or atmospheric moisture will promote the cure of material in shadowed regions. Although functional strength is developed almost instantly due to the UV curing nature of LOCTITE® SI 5092™, increased cure properties are developed during 72 hours at ambient conditions.


Surface Cure


When curing with sufficient UV light irradiance, exposed material will cure dry to the touch in seconds. Atmospheric moisture cures material not exposed to UV light.


Depth of Cure


Shadowed areas rely on surface and/or atmospheric moisture to effect cure. Depth of cure is limited to approximately 6 millimeters and will take at least 24 hours to develop. Rapid depth of cure can be attained with focused UV light.
