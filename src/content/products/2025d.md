sellingPoints:
  - Excellent dispense capabilities
  - For mother die in array packaging
  - 260ºC reflow capability for Pb-free applications
shortDescription: LOCTITE ABLESTIK 2025D is a Silica filled die attach adhesive with excellent dispense capabilities, designed for use in array packaging. Even though its properties are exceptional, Silica has the downside of potentially scratching the dies. That's why manufacturers tend to prefer the QMI range of products for stacking. LOCTITE ABLESTIK 2025D has exceptional adhesion on Copper, excellent die sheer strength and MSL performance, something that makes it the product of choice for the first (mother) die. It performs excellently for this application and it compliments nicely the QMI products on die stacking applications. This product has low to medium modulus and can also be used for individual large die. This 0.4 W/mK product has also been qualified for automotive lid attach.

### What is a push tip and a screw tip


Tips are the plastic caps placed on the syringe's nozzle that need to be removed before dispensing.


Push tip is a type of tip that goes inside the nozzle while Screw tip wraps around the edge of the nozzle. There are no real functional differences other than this one and shouldn't affect the fit, form, function, or any aspect of the customer's process.


IDHs 1201771 and 1203572 have recently gone through this improvement process so this is a good place to share this information, just in case you were "affected".
