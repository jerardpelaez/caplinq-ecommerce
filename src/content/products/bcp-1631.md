shortDescription: Linqsol BCP-1631 is a self-adhesive thermoplastic coating powder capable of achieving a breakdown voltage of up to 49 kV/mm. It is a semi-crystalline powder that exhibits a high melt flow and low melt temperature, which is ideal for the high-speed coating of thin and complex parts. A distinctive feature of Linqsol BCP-1631 is that it has a virtually infinite shelf life when stored at room temperature since cross-linking is unnecessary for coating. It is very easy to apply, environmentally friendly, and great for applications where cold impact resistance of up to -30C is required. This thermoplastic is used in technical and functional applications and offers excellent flexibility, elongation, and resistance to stress cracking. Some application ideas are copper busbars, valves, and fittings, industrial springs, rail guards, cable trays, etc. Advantages of BCP-1631 Excellent adhesion and elongation Good moisture barrier Excellent cold impact Good chemical resistance
