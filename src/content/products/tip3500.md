shortDescription: Honeywell's TIP3500 thermal insulator pad comes in a blue color and offers thickness ranging from 0.25 - 0.50mm. While the Breakdown voltage between TIP 1500 and TIP 3500 is identical and they are both V0 rated, their dielectric properties differ, mostly as an effect of the different thicknesses. It is ideal for Automotive electronics and Power conversion and supply equipment and comes with a single sided Pressure sensitive adhesive for easy assembly. Honeywell's TIP3500 thermal insulator pad is designed to provide low thermal impedance and high isolation for high power and high voltage applications. Integrated fiberglass reinforcement protects the pad from tears, cut-throughs and punctures.It is designed to be soft and conformal which provides excellent mating surface for low pressure mounting.
