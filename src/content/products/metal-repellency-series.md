  - Renders metal surfaces hydrophobic/oleophobic
  - 2-4 nm thickness
  - Repellent to nearly any liquid
shortDescription: Aculon's metal repellency technology renders any metal surface hydrophobic, oleophobic, and repellent to nearly any liquid. It is a nanoscale surface treatment that is easy to apply, optically clear, and ultra-thin (2-4nm). This treatment can be applied via several application methods, including dip and wipe, and no capital equipment is required. Advantages of Aculon's Metal Repellency Treatment Repels water, oil, and organic material Long-lasting durable repellent performance Apply in minutes High chemical resistance Nontoxic, non-ozone depleting

### How to apply Metal Repellency Treatment






STEP 1 ⇨ CLEAN




STEP 2 ⇨ TREAT




STEP 3 ⇨ DRY






 










Parts must be **sufficiently clean** before treatment for proper bonding and effective application.


Dip - Fully immerse the part in the treatment solution for 30 seconds. Withdraw the part at a steady rate to ensure even coverage. Allow to dry or cure depending on your substrate. Aculon Metal Repellency Treatment comes in 30 ml or 1L kits for dipping applications.




If curing is necessary (short dip times are used), the treated substrates are best cured at 120⁰C peak metal temperature for approximately 30 seconds.


For silicon and titanium oxides, lengthening the cure time to 5 minutes is recommended.


Aluminum does not need a cure if the dipping time is lengthened to 5 minutes/room temperature, otherwise, a cure is recommended.






Wipe - Using a clean cloth apply the treatment by wiping it across the surface in a buffing motion for 1 minute per square foot. Aculon Metal Repellency Treatment comes in pre-moistened wipes, 30 ml or 1L kits for wiping applications.








### How to test for Hydrophobicity


To test for hydrophobicity, allow water droplets to fall onto the surface, which should bead up to a contact angle >90⁰. If the contact angle is Application Ideas





Impart repellency to stainless steel, pipes, and other


industrial metals and materials




**Non-fouling (ink-repellent) surface for printer nozzles**


**Nonstick film for inside micro heat exchanger**




Any application where added liquid repellency of metal


surfaces is beneficial
