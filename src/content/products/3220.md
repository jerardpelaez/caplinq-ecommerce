shortDescription: LOCTITE 3220 heat cure adhesive is designed for use in the sealing of heat sensitive electronic components. It is a multi purpose, single component epoxy with excellent adhesion that requires no mixing and cures fast at low temperatures. LOCTITE 3220 is typically used as an adhesive or sealant for image sensors and MMC, MultiMediaCard devices. It is one of the adhesives with the lowest cure temperature (bar RTVs) and exhibits high adhesion on FR4, glass and many engineering plastics Heat Cure 5-10 minutes @ 80°C 1hour @ 60°C
