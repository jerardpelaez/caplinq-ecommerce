shortDescription: LOCTITE® ECCOBOND UF 9000AE is a cutting-edge semiconductor capillary underfill designed specifically to meet the demands of next-generation flip-chip BGA (FCBGA) and high-density fan-out (HD-FO)/2.5D integrated advanced packaging designs. These technologies, critical for AI and high-performance computing (HPC) applications, feature large, high-density I/O die within expansive package dimensions, making warpage prevention and die protection crucial for long-term reliability. LOCTITE® ECCOBOND UF 9000AE excels in this environment by offering robust protection against die warpage and cracking, which are common concerns due to the fine-pitch interconnects found on large die. This PFAS-free epoxy encapsulant boasts a fast flow rate, ensuring that it can fill gaps efficiently while maintaining the integrity of the delicate interconnects. Its high fracture toughness further enhances durability, ensuring that the die remains protected under various operational stresses. Once fully cured, LOCTITE® ECCOBOND UF 9000AE forms a rigid, self-filleting protective seal that significantly improves the reliability of solder joints. This protective layer not only extends the electrical, thermal, and moisture resistance of the package but also helps to dissipate stress, thereby enhancing overall performance and longevity. The underfill’s low thermal expansion, fast capillary flow, and extended work-life make it an ideal solution for complex, high-density semiconductor packages, ensuring both comprehensive interconnect protection and high processability. It is the best underfill for large die sizes and flip chips applications with small gaps. Applications Flip-Chip Ball Grid Array (BGA), Cu Pillar Package, and other high-density interconnect designs Cure schedule 15 minute ramp to 100°C; 90 minute hold @ 100°C + 15 minute ramp from 100°C to 165°C; 2 hour hold @ 165°C
