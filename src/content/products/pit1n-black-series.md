shortDescription: "LINQTAPE PIT1N-B is a black high-temperature resistant polyimide film designed for both permanent and temporary bonding in many high-temperature applications. These applications can be found in semiconductor, smartcard, electronic, automotive, and general manufacturing industries. It is ideal for applications that require the balancing of multiple properties over a wide temperature range. LINQTAPE PIT1N-B film provides an excellent balance of electrical, mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties, and can be used in applications that may see temperatures up to 400°C. This film has an opaque black coloring, which results in almost no light transmission, higher heat resistance, and higher resistivity than the standard PIT1N. LINQTAPE™ PIT1N-B Film comes in 33-meter (36-yard) rolls of varying widths. LINQTAPE PIT-N polyimide films without adhesive are available in a range of thicknesses, starting from 0.5 mil (12.7µm) thickness and up. Custom thicknesses are available upon request. Key Features: High-temperature applications Thin film without adhesive Excellent electrical properties"
