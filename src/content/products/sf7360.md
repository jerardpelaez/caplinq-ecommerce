shortDescription: LOCTITE® SF 7360 is a clear, low-viscosity, aliphatic ester blend, non-CFC solvent cleaner. This low odour formulation is intended for the removal of uncured adhesive and adhesive residues found following PCB assembly. The solvent is fully compatible with epoxy adhesives and will not cause hardening during soaking. LOCTITE® SF 7360 is a stencil and nozzle cleaner, recommended for cleaning of stencils, screens and dispensing nozzles used to apply surface mount adhesives and for removal of adhesives from misprinted circuit boards. It's a great solution to dissolve and remove residues. LOCTITE® SF 7360 has no effect on the speed of cure or final strength of LOCTITE® adhesives other than providing a clean surface for good adhesion and adhesive cure. Unclean or partially cleaned surfaces can affect adhesive performance. The solvent is fully compatible with commonly used solder resists.

This product is not recommended for use in pure oxygen and/or oxygen rich systems and should not be selected with a sealant for chlorine or other strong oxidizing materials.


It is advisable to use protective clothing to avoid contact with the solvent and adhesive. The low volatility of this solvent makes it ideal for open reservoirs but does mean that it requires drying by cloth or compressed air.
