shortDescription: LOCTITE MSC 01 high performance cleaning solution is developed for solder paste cleaning processes. This material can be used manually or with an automatic stencil underside wiper. It comes with reduced VOC and fast evaporation but keep in mind that it contains flammable alcohol. This cleaning product has high solvency and does not leave oily residues, reducing its environmental impact. LOCTITE MSC 01 is recommended to be used for screen or stencil cleaning equipment but it is also suitable for printer automatic wipe systems, manual cleaning operations and reworking. It has good compatibility with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, butyl rubber, epoxy adhesives, fiducial epoxies, natural rubber, nitrile rubber, nylon, polyurethane squeegees, polycarbonates, polyethylenes, polypropylenes, polytetrafluoroethylene, PTFE squeegees and SBR rubbers.
