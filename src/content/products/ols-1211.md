shortDescription: OPTOLINQ OLS-1211 is a two-component (Part A & Part B), low halogen, optically clear epoxy casting compound designed for the encapsulation of LED lamps and displays. Part A is an epoxy resin while part B is primarily a modified curing agent. OPTOLINQ OLS-1211 offers excellent bonding properties to a wide range of substrates and good resistance against heat aging, cold and thermal shock. Additionally, this epoxy encapsulant features over then 99% visible light transmittance and low light decay. It has much better UV resistance and antiblue properties than OLS1000. OPTOLINQ OLS-1211 has been developed for applications that will not be exposed to temperatures above 125°C but it can pass the SMD reflow process at 260 °C. It has been used extensively for low-power LED encapsulation, automatic LED casting, and potting of large optoelectronic modules. It can be colored and diffused by the addition of specific dye and diffusing concentrates.

### Operating instructions


We recommend to process the product in a clean room at room temperature with a relative humidity lower than 35%.



- Preheat Part A to 50-55°C for 2 hours, making sure that you adjust this to the external temperature. Do not preheat for more that 24 hours.

- Mix part A with the diffusion agent and the pigment and stir well. Afterwards add Part B in a 100:100 ratio.

- To ensure that all the entrapped air bubbles are removed after mixing, the mixture of Part A and B should be done in a vacuum and degassed at 0.1MPa for 10-15 minutes.

- Clean and dry the glue injection tool. Use it within 90minutes in room temperature and under tightly sealed conditions, ideally in a vacuum.






### Curing


It is advised to cure in two stages to reduce thermal stress.



- The mixture should be cured in the oven within 30 minutes after dispensing.

- The oven should be already preheated to the curing temperature.

- After the initial cure is finished the post curing should be carried out within 2 hours, ideally in the same oven.




Cure Schedule



- 1hour @ 130-135°C + 6-8hours @ 130-135°C

- 1hour @ 125-130°C + 6-8hours @ 130-135°C

- 1hour @ 105-120°C + 6-8hours @ 130-135°C




This schedule is a general recommended guideline for DIP LED that has to be adjusted based on your package type and package size. Smaller packages might benefit from a shorter Post cure schedule (ie 125°C for 4 hours) to avoid stress build up. If you have doubts whether the product has fully cured, you can run a DSC analysis on the cured sample and observe the exothermic heat flow. If there's none, it would signify that the epoxy is fully crosslinked or cured.


Post Curing is not advised to skip. The post-curing step is where the full potential of the encapsulant is achieved such as strength, hardness, thermal stability, and reliability to name a few. Skipping cure, on the other hand, means incomplete epoxy cure which will increase the risk of delamination, and package crack. If epoxy is fully cured, there will be no residual unreacted material.


### Using Additives


Optolinq OLS-1211 can be mixed with diffusing agents or color pastes to achieve customer-specific purposes.


Recommended quantity of various diffusing agents and color pastes:



- OPC-R Red Color Paste: 0.1-0.5% by epoxy weight

- OPC-B Blue Color Paste: 0.1-0.5% by epoxy weight

- OPC-G Green Color Paste: 0.1-0.5% by epoxy weight

- ODF-090 Diffusing Agent: 3-5% by weight (LED lamps), 4-8% (LED displays)




For example, ODF would be 100 : 100 : 3~5 for LED lamps
