shortDescription: DMI CS-783 is a methacrylated, epoxy-functional hybrid cyclosiloxane monomer engineered to enhance adhesion and compatibility in advanced resin systems. Its unique structure allows participation in both free-radical polymerization and epoxy curing mechanisms, offering broad versatility for formulating high-performance adhesives, coatings, and composite materials. Used primarily as an adhesion promoter for mold compounds, metal surfaces, and polyimides, DMI CS-783 improves interfacial bonding without sacrificing processing ease. Additionally, it serves as a multifunctional diluent, reducing viscosity and enhancing flow properties across a wide range of resin systems. Soluble in most common resins, DMI CS-783 simplifies formulation without compromising performance. Applications Adhesion promoter for mold compounds, metals, and polyimide surfaces Reactive diluent for epoxy, hybrid, and UV-curable systems Formulations requiring dual-cure compatibility (free-radical and epoxy cures) B-staged and hybrid adhesives, coatings, and composites

Recommended Formulation Use



- CS-783 is recommended for use as an adhesion promoter to mold compounds and metal substrates. Typical addition levels are 1-5% of the total resin. CS-783 can also be used for standard epoxy curatives, catalysts, B-staged and/or hybrid adhesives.
