shortDescription: LOCTITE ABLESTIK ICP 8282 is an electrically conductive acrylate adhesive designed for applications where fast cure is required. This single component, snap cure material is ideally suited for high throughput photovoltaic print processes and applications where high adhesion strength is required. LOCTITE ABLESTIK ICP 8282 achieves low and stable contact resistance on noble metallisation during reliability testing. It has low silver content that reduces its density making it a very cost effective conductive material compared to similar fast cure products such as CA 3556HF. It is typically used for flexible interconnects in photovoltaic and solar panel shingle applications and also on stencil printing processes that need to print at high speeds and high volumes. Snap Cure 10 to 15 seconds @ 150°C

Protip By applying a flat and thin 100-200um layer using JET dispensing or STENCIL printing (instead of one domed dot), we believe that the flow out and bleeding can be reduced by lower gravity forces.
