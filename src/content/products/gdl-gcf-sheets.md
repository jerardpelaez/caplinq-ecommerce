shortDescription: "Spectracarb™ product line has been discontinued since 2020. CAPLINQ has developed LINQCELL™ Carbon Fiber Paper GDL a better and more cost-effective alternative Spectracarb™ 2050A Gas Diffusion Layer (GDL) sheets are sometimes called porous carbon gas diffusion layer. They are porous graphitized resin-bonded carbon fiber papers and multi-ply panels specifically designed for use in PEM, DMFC and PAFC fuel cells, Electrolyzers, Humidifiers and Other Electrochemical Devices. Spectracarb 2050A Series Porous Graphitized Sheets and Panel Spectracarb™ 2050A Porous Carbon Gas Diffusion Layer (GDL) sheets are porous graphitized resin-bonded carbon fiber papers and multi-ply panels specifically designed for use in PEM, DMFC and PAFC fuel cells, Electrolyzers, Humidifiers, and Other Electrochemical Devices These products are optimized for the following properties: Electrical Conductivity Mechanical Strength and Durability Gas/Air Permeability Water Management Spectracarb GDLs are produced in the USA and are available in a wide range of standard and custom grades, densities, sizes and materials for fuel cells, electrolyzers, humidifiers, specialty batteries and other electrochemical applications. Advantages of EFT Fibers' Spectracarb Series GDLs Spectracarb GDL has a specific technology focus: Widest Range of Production Grades Available Lower Cost Products Small / Specialty Orders Accepted Experimental & Developmental Formulations (Laboratory /Pilot Scale) Contract Research /Joint Development Programs for Special Requirements Established 22-Year Manufacturing History (Spectracorp Founded 1991) Spectracarb GDL 2050 Series Sizes, Thicknesses, and Densities The Spectracarb 2050 Series GDL sheet sizes are 55 x 55 cm. Custom sizes, machined discs, and other customer-defined sizes and shapes, as well as channels and surface grinding, are available upon request for large quantities."
