shortDescription: PEAM-645 is a polyester acrylate/methacrylate that exhibits low CTE, high Tg, and high modulus. The oligomer has very high thermal stability and low volatility. It can be used as a base resin in a formulation or as an additive. It exhibits good adhesion on various substrates. The oligomer also exhibits good hydrolytic stability PEAM-645 is recommended for use as a base resin in adhesive applications or coating applications. The material if used alone can exhibit brittleness and the incorporation of a toughener (such as ABS, or hyperbranched polyester) is recommended. The oligomer has good solubility in both aliphatic and aromatic co-monomers. PEAM-645 is more akin to epoxies with the smaller molecular weight (still big compared to most epoxies but much smaller than the PEAM-1044) and with higher Tg as a result. It common to mix these product for optimal results.
