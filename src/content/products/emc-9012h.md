  - High glass transition temperature, low stress, and excellent reliability performance
shortDescription: "LINQSOL™ EMC-9012H is a green epoxy molding compound specifically developed for the encapsulation of Ball Grid Array (BGA) and Quad Flat No Leads (QFN) packages. Its long spiral flow at 175 °C satisfies the moldability requirement for BGA and QFN molding. LINQSOL™ EMC-9012H has a high glass transition temperature designed to pass higher reliability requirements. Additionally, with a UL 94 V-0 flammability rating and ultra-low water absorption, EMC-9012H guarantees excellent performance and outstanding reliability. This product is deliberately formulated without the inclusion of substances prohibited by the European Union RoHS and REACH. Overall, LINQSOL™ EMC-9012H seamlessly integrates advanced material properties, safety compliance, and superior performance to deliver a reliable solution for semiconductor device encapsulation. Key Features Long spiral flow (165 cm @ 175 °C) — Reliable fill of fine-pitch BGA/QFN with fewer voids and shorts. High Tg (158 °C) — Better margin through reflow and high-temp operation. Low moisture (0.36% @ boiling) — Reduces popcorn and delamination risk. Low ionic residue (Cl⁻ 7 ppm, Na⁺ 4 ppm) — Minimizes corrosion/CAF for long-term reliability. Controlled CTE (10/40 ppm/°C) — Helps limit warpage and die/package stress. UL-94 V-0 — Meets stringent safety requirements. Low mold shrinkage (0.16%) — Dimensional stability for tight tolerances. Green, RoHS & REACH compliant — Halogen-free formulation aligned with global regulations. Application/Suitable For: BGA (standard and fine-pitch), QFN (thin-profile, fine-pitch) transfer molding High-cavitation molds requiring fast, balanced flow and consistent gate-to-gate fill Packages targeting low warpage, reflow survivability, and high reliability (consumer, industrial, networking, storage)"
