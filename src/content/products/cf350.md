shortDescription: LINQCELL CF350 is a 0.35mm thick carbon cloth without a Microporous layer and PTFE. It is commonly used as a gas diffusion layer and electrode for fuel cells. Its through-plane resistivity is less rhN 5 mΩcm2. LINQCELL CF350 carbon cloth is typically used in PEM fuel cells as well as Phosphoric acid fuel cells and Direct methanol fuel cell applications as a gas diffusion layer. Carbon cloth based GDLs have performance equal to that of conventional carbon papers. Carbon cloth is more practical than carbon paper because of its superior compressibility, elasticity, and flexibility performance, making it more appropriate for ongoing manufacturing and assembly processes. These thinner gas diffusion layers lend themselves better to AEMFC GDL Anodes. Thickness has more sensitivity to the AEMFC when used in the anode electrode rather than in the cathode electrode, indicating that water removal at the anode was more challenging than water supply at the cathode so the strategy of water management among electrodes should be differentiated.
