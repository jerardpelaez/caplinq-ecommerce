apiId: 4882
name: LOCTITE ABLESTIK ABP2034
slug: abp2034
sku: ABP2034
brand: CAPLINQ
category: electrically-conductive-adhesives
subcategory: electrically-conductive-adhesives
sellingPoints:
  - Ultra low modulus
  - High adhesion
  - Low temperature cure
shortDescription: LOCTITE ABLESTIK ABP 2034 low temperature cure, electrically conductive adhesive is designed for use in applications requiring low modulus and high adhesion strength. This can be a good alternative to ICP4000 for hermetic sealing if you prefer to avoid silicon contamination. LOCTITE ABLESTIK ABP 2034 (Ag filled BMI hybrid) is developed for conductive bonding in high-volume consumer devices. Both show excellent adhesion in interfaces such as SUS and Nickel in heat sensitive applications such as bracket grounding and VCM assembly for Camera modules. It can be used for batteries that require curing temperatures below 80° or even 60°C. Cure Schedule 120 minutes @ 80°C

### What are the outgassing expectations of ABP2034?


The expected weight loss for this material after 2hrs at 80°C is 1.4%. From experience with other silver filled adhesives we know that Total Mass Loss (TML) will be far below 1% AFTER cure. We do not have Collected Volatile Condensable Materials (CVCM) data, but do expect this to be below 0.1% based on comparable materials. We recommend you measure the outgassing of cured ABP 2034 YOURSELVES if this is critical for your application. If needed, applying a longer post bake after cure can be considered to further reduce the outgassing after cure.




### Can ABP2034 be used for cryogenic applications?


ABP 2034 has proved to be best performing down to -269°C (dipping in Helium) on larger parts. Of course, this will depend on the metal type and substrate finish of the sensors. This very low modulus and low temp (80°C) curable ECA is typically tested for small sensors, so you must check if the adhesion is strong enough at wire bonding temperatures.


An alternative could be ICP 2120 which has a higher modulus for wire bonding, but where we don't have enough data for cryogenic temperatures.
