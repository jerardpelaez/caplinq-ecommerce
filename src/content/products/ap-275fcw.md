sellingPoints:
  - Improves wetting performance
  - Excellent solderability and fast wetting
  - Low spattering
shortDescription: KESTER 275 No-Clean Flux for cored solder wire was developed to provide superior wetting performance for hand soldering in the electronics industry. The chemistry is based on some of the same principles that have been safely used for years in mildly activated rosin fluxes. The use of 275 No-Clean Flux results in an extremely clear post-soldering residue without cleaning. The unique chemistry in 275 was also designed to reduce spattering common to most core fluxes. 275 can be used for both lead-free and leaded soldering. 275 is classified as ROL0 per J-STD-004. Product Key Features Superior wetting performance Leaves clear, non-corrosive residue that does not require cleaning. Reduced spattering Minimizes flux spatter during soldering. ROL0 per J-STD-004 for reliability. Applications Designed for hand soldering.

### Instructions for Use

Solder iron tip temperatures are most commonly between 315 to 343 &deg;C (600 to 650 &deg;F) for Sn63Pb37 and Sn62Pb36Ag02 alloys, and between 371 to 400 &deg;C (700 to 750 &deg;F) for lead-free alloys. Heat both the land area and component lead to be soldered with the iron prior to touching the land with the cored wire. Do not apply the wire directly to the soldering iron tip. If needed, 959T or 985M no clean flux may be used as a compatible liquid flux to aid in reworking soldered joints. 959T is available as a Flux-Pen&reg; for optimum board cleanliness.
