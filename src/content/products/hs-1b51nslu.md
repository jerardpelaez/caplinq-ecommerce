## Frequently Asked Questions About HumiSeal® 1B51NSLU



### What are typical applications for HumiSeal® 1B51NSLU?




HumiSeal® 1B51NSLU is a fast-drying, single-component synthetic rubber conformal coating. Due to its unique polymer base, it provides an exceptionally low moisture vapor permeability, making it an excellent choice for protecting printed circuit board assemblies (PCBs) in high-humidity and demanding environments. Its flexibility and low stress on components make it a reliable choice for a variety of industries, including:



- Automotive electronics (e.g., in-cabin and under-the-hood)

- Industrial control systems

- Military electronics

- Renewable energy systems




This coating is particularly well-suited for applications that require superior protection against moisture and environmental stressors, where a simple and flexible coating system is preferred.




### Why choose HumiSeal® 1B51NSLU over other conformal coatings?




HumiSeal® 1B51NSLU is a high-performance synthetic rubber formulation that dries quickly at ambient temperature. It stands out due to its extremely low moisture vapor permeability, superior flexibility, and low stress on components. Unlike some coatings, it includes a UV fluorescent tracer for easy inspection, and it is easily repaired. It leverages an environmentally friendly solvent blend, making it a more sustainable choice. The coating's viscosity is optimized for spray, brush, or dip application. It meets the requirements of the RoHS Directive 2011/65/EC (and 2015/863/EU).






### What is the shelf life of HumiSeal® 1B51NSLU?


HumiSeal® 1B51NSLU has a shelf life of 12 months from the date of manufacture when stored at room temperature in a tightly closed container, away from excessive heat or cold. As a fast-drying solvent-based material, it is crucial to protect the product from ambient air to prevent premature polymerization and solvent evaporation. Therefore, any open or partial containers should be tightly sealed after use.




### How should I clean and rework HumiSeal® 1B51NSLU?


For coating removal during rework, the cured film can be selectively removed using thermal displacement (e.g., a soldering iron), mechanical abrasion, or a chemical stripper. HumiSeal® Stripper 1080 is a suitable option for stripping the cured film.






### What happens to HumiSeal® 1B51NSLU after its shelf life?


After the shelf life, the material's viscosity may increase, and its application characteristics may degrade. This can lead to improper application, uneven coating, and a reduction in the protective performance of the cured film. The use of expired material is not recommended as it may compromise the quality and reliability of the coating. Due to its solvent-based nature, proper storage is critical to maintaining product integrity.




### How does HumiSeal® 1B51NSLU cure, and why do drying times vary?


HumiSeal® 1B51NSLU is a single-component, fast-drying coating. It is dry to the touch in approximately 10 minutes and will be ready for handling. A full cure is achieved after 24 hours at room temperature (25°C) or within 30 minutes at an elevated temperature of 76°C. The time required to reach optimum protective properties is approximately 7 days. Drying times can vary based on ambient conditions; higher temperature and lower humidity will accelerate the drying process.






### What is the recommended thickness for HumiSeal® 1B51NSLU?


The recommended coating thickness for HumiSeal® 1B51NSLU is 25 to 75 microns (1-3 mils). This thickness range ensures optimal protective performance while maintaining flexibility and electrical properties. The final thickness can be adjusted based on the application method and specific project requirements.




### What are the differences between application methods for HumiSeal® 1B51NSLU?


HumiSeal® 1B51NSLU can be applied by dipping, spraying, or brushing. Dipping is often used for high-volume, automated processes, providing uniform coverage for complex geometries. Spraying, using conventional spray equipment, is ideal for selective application and achieving a consistent film. Brushing is suitable for rework or small-scale applications, offering precise control in localized areas. For all methods, ensuring adequate ventilation is crucial to prevent the build-up of flammable solvent vapors.






### What is the maximum operating temperature for HumiSeal® 1B51NSLU?


HumiSeal® 1B51NSLU has a continuous use operating temperature range of –65°C to +125°C, providing consistent protection across a wide range of thermal conditions. It is capable of withstanding thermal shock within this range, as demonstrated by its compliance with MIL-I-46058C testing.




### What safety precautions should I take when using HumiSeal® 1B51NSLU?


HumiSeal® 1B51NSLU contains flammable solvents, so it should be used in well-ventilated areas and kept away from open flames or sparks. Prevent skin and eye contact by wearing appropriate personal protective equipment, including safety glasses and solvent-resistant gloves. Avoid inhalation of vapors and spray mist. Always consult the product's Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for detailed handling, storage, and disposal information.






### How can I ensure proper application of HumiSeal® 1B51NSLU?


HumiSeal® 1B51NSLU contains a UV fluorescent tracer, which makes it easy to inspect under a blacklight. This allows for quick and efficient quality control to ensure proper coverage and uniformity. Visual inspection under UV light is the primary method for ensuring proper application and can reveal areas that were missed or have an inconsistent thickness.




### How does HumiSeal® 1B51NSLU perform in harsh environments?


HumiSeal® 1B51NSLU provides excellent protection against moisture, humidity, and chemical exposure. The cured synthetic rubber film is tough and flexible, ensuring long-term integrity against environmental stressors. Due to its extremely low moisture vapor permeability, this coating is an ideal solution for applications where PCBs are exposed to high humidity and corrosive agents.
