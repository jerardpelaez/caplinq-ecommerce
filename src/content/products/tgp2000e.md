shortDescription: Honeywell TGP2000E Thermal Gap Filler Pads provide high thermal performance with ease of use across multitude of applications. Its ultra-high compressibility enables low stress and excellent conformity to mating surfaces. It is designed to minimize thermal resistance at interfaces, and maintain excellent performance through reliability testing. TGP2000E is naturally tacky, and requires no additional adhesive which could inhibit thermal performance. Even though these pads come in large dimensions, it is suggested to cut and apply them in smaller pieces to ensure part uniformity and to avoid any issues related to their application. Products are available in a thickness range from 0.5mm to 5.0mm.
