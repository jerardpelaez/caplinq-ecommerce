## Frequently Asked Questions About HGP12 (12 W/m&middot;K Ultra-Soft Thermal Gap Pad)

### What are typical applications for HGP12?

HGP12 is used as a high-performance thermal interface material for heat dissipation in sensitive electronic modules.

- Optical modules

- Telecommunications equipment TIM

- High-power lighting such as LCD, LED, projectors

- Automotive MCU control units

### Why choose HGP12 over alternatives?

HGP12 combines very high thermal conductivity (12 W/m&middot;K) with ultra-soft, low-pressure compression, low volatility, and extremely low siloxane content&mdash;making it ideal for sensitive electronics where contamination control and stress-free assembly are critical.

### What is the shelf life of HGP12?

HGP12 has a shelf life of 12 months when stored at 0&ndash;35&deg;C and below 65% relative humidity.

### How do I clean tools after applying HGP12?

Tools can be cleaned using standard solvents suitable for silicone-based TIM removal, such as isopropyl alcohol or other electronics-safe cleaners.

### What happens after shelf life?

After the shelf life expires, material softness and compression characteristics may change, potentially affecting thermal performance and assembly reliability.

### How do I cure HGP12?

HGP12 is a ready-to-use gap pad and requires no curing. It is installed as-is between components and heat spreaders.

Applications That Benefit Most from High Thermal Conductive HGP12

Case 1: Improving Thermal Efficiency in High-Density 5G RF Amplifiers 5G telecom base stations rely on high-power RF power amplifier (PA) modules that generate significant heat densities. As module power output increases, maintaining thermal stability and preventing derating becomes a major design challenge which may results to thermal throttling.

Technical Issues:

- Hotspots of +18&deg;C above average due to poor conformability

- Module derating occurred during extended high power operation

- Long-term reliability concerns (voiding, pump-out, bleed contamination)

Case 2: Enhancing Thermal Management in High-Power Industrial LED Lighting

High-power industrial LED fixtures such as those used in factories, warehouses, tunnels, and outdoor infrastructure operate continuously and generate significant heat at the LED junction. Excess heat leads to lumen depreciation, color shift, and premature failure, making efficient thermal management essential for maintaining long service life and consistent light output.

Technical Issues:

- LED junction temperatures exceeding design limits, causing early lumen drop-off

- Hotspot formation due to uneven metal-core PCB (MCPCB) surface contact

- Thermal grease dry-out over time leading to increased thermal resistance

- Long-term reliability concerns during 24/7 operation in hot or enclosed environments

**Case 3: Improving Thermal Control in AI Servers and GPU Accelerator Modules**

Modern AI training and inference servers use multi-die GPU accelerators that generate extreme heat fluxes, especially during sustained workloads. Maintaining low thermal resistance across complex module topographies is essential to prevent performance throttling and maintain system uptime in data centers.

Technical Issues:

- High heat flux (exceeding 300 W/cm&sup2;) from stacked GPU dies

- Gap variation due to tolerances in heat spreaders and interposers

- Performance throttling during extended ML training workloads

- Long-term aging concerns with traditional pads at elevated temperatures

**Case 4: Thermal Stabilization in Automotive ADAS Control Units**

Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) rely on high-power processors, radar modules, and sensor fusion units that operate continuously under harsh automotive temperature cycles. These compact modules generate high heat loads that must be controlled to prevent thermal throttling and loss of processing performance.

Technical Issues:

- Peak temperatures approaching thermal throttling threshold during continuous lane-assist operation

- Uneven PCB-to-housing gaps due to vibration and mechanical tolerances

- Traditional gap fillers showing micro-voiding after extended thermal cycling

- Risk of reduced processing speed and degraded ADAS reliability

How HGP12 Helps in These Cases

Solstice HGP12 provides a consistent thermal advantage across all the applications mentioned. Its high thermal conductivity of 12 W/m&middot;K allows heat to move quickly away from critical components, helping to lower junction temperatures and prevent performance loss under heavy load. Overall, HGP12 supports reliable heat transfer, improves operational stability, and helps extend the lifetime of electronics that operate under high thermal stress.
