## OPTOLINQ TMC-2100IR Powder for Compression Molding


The particle-size distribution of TMC-2100IR coarse powder is tightly centred on a median diameter (D50) of 129.9 µm. Only 10 vol % of particles are finer than 36.7 µm (D10) and 90 vol % are below 280.6 µm (D90), giving a span of 1.88 that denotes a moderately narrow, well-graded curve.


Most particles fall between roughly 40 µm and 280 µm, supplying enough fines to fill interstices without dusty handling and few oversize granules that might entrap air during mould filling. The volume-average diameter D[4,3] of 145.5 µm confirms mass clustering near the median, while a specific surface area of 29.9 m²kg⁻¹ signals moderate binder demand. Because our process controls D50 within 80–160 µm, future lots will closely replicate this flow and packing behavior.
