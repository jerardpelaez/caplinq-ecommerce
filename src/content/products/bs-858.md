shortDescription: "Thermelt 858 Black is a non-reactive, solvent-free copolymer polyamide hot melt resin, specially developed for low pressure molding (LPM) applications requiring enhanced UV resistance, high cohesion, and superior mechanical durability. It is ideally suited for the encapsulation and protection of electronic and electrical components, connectors, and cable junctions—especially in environments with UV exposure or where surface hardness is a key requirement. Formulated for outdoor and semi-outdoor applications, Thermelt 858 delivers excellent adhesion, robust mechanical properties, and UL94 V-0 flammability rating, while maintaining long-term performance in thermally and electrically demanding environments. Thermelt 858 was developed specifically for improving adhesion on a wide range of substrates and offers cohesiveness at negative temperatures (-35°C). It is mainly used for molding of electronic/electric components, connectors and cables. Typical Applications: Overmolding of automotive sensors and connectors exposed to sunlight Potting of industrial control units, LED drivers, and junction boxes Protective molding for outdoor telecom and sensor assemblies"
