shortDescription: "LOCTITE® AA 3321 is primarily designed for bonding rigid or flexible PVC to polycarbonate where large gap-filling capabilities and flexible joints are desired. The product has shown excellent adhesion to a wide variety of substrates including glass, many plastics and most metals. The thixotropic nature of LOCTITE® AA 3321™ reduces the migration of liquid products after application to the substrate. LOCTITE® AA 3321 is a transparent, light yellow, light-cured, universal, acrylic-based instant adhesive, suitable for metals and stress-sensitive plastics with a high, on-demand, curing speed. It passes the ISO-10993 test protocol. LOCTITE® AA 3321 can be cured by exposure to UV and/or visible light of sufficient intensity. To obtain full cure on surfaces exposed to air, radiation @ 220 to 260 nm is also required. The speed of cure will depend upon the UV intensity and spectral distribution of the light source, the exposure time and the light transmittance of the substrates. Fixture Time Fixture time is defined as the time to develop a shear strength of 0.1 N/mm². UV Fixture Time, Glass microscope slides, seconds: Black light, Zeta® 7500 light source: 6 mW/cm², measured @ 365 nm ≤15LMS"
