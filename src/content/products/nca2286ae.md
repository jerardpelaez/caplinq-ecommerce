shortDescription: LOCTITE ABLESTIK NCA 2286AE dual cure acrylic adhesive is designed for use in active alignment applications in camera module assembly. It has been formulated to a high viscosity and thixotropy to enable higher aspect ratios of dispensed adhesive, thus allowing for easier adjustments for the final assembly. This material jas a very high dispense aspect ration and is engineered to meet the high reliability performance requirements for the optoelectronic / semiconductor industry. This version is redeveloped to provide lower transmittance and higher adhesion after full cure. This material also provides better toughness and reliability performance after 85ºC/85% aging. LOCTITE ABLESTIK NCA 2286AE is black in color to prevent light penetration into the final assembled device. It is designed to achieve fast cure response at low temperatures and good depth of cure after UV radiation. This product also contains a secondary thermal cure mechanism for applications with shadowed areas where light is unable to penetrate. It is a camera/sensor market material that is not expected to pass very harsh reliability requirements. Cure Schedule UV Light UV Wavelength, nm 220 to 380 Light Intensity, mW/cm² 1,000 Exposure Time, seconds 4 Secondary Heat Cure 1 hour @ 80°C
