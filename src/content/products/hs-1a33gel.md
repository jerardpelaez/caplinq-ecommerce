shortDescription: HumiSeal® 1A33 GEL is a single-component, thixotropic gel based on polyurethane chemistry, specifically formulated to protect printed circuit board (PCB) assemblies. This solvent-free, non-flammable gel offers superior edge coverage and exceptional moisture protection for demanding applications. Its unique gel consistency allows for precise application without the mess of traditional coatings, and it fluoresces under UV light for easy inspection and quality control. HumiSeal® 1A33 GEL can be applied by a variety of methods including dispensing, brushing, or syringe. Unlike liquid coatings, its viscosity is not adjustable with thinners. It cures through a moisture-cure mechanism, where ambient humidity initiates the curing process. While it will skin over in approximately 30-40 minutes at room temperature, it achieves optimum properties after 30 days at RT, or optionally, through accelerated curing at 30 hours @ 76°C or 20 hours @ 88°C. HumiSeal® 1A33 GEL is engineered to meet stringent industry specifications, including MIL-I-46058C and RoHS Directive 2011/65/EU. Target Applications General printed circuit board applications Automotive electronic applications, including in-cabin and exterior use. Military equipment requiring durable performance. Renewable energy systems needing robust electronic reliability. Industrial controls exposed to high humidity, salt-spray, and corrosive environments.

## Frequently Asked Questions About HumiSeal® 1A33 GEL



### What are typical applications for HumiSeal® 1A33 GEL?


HumiSeal® 1A33 GEL is ideal for protecting printed circuit board assemblies (PCBs) or spot coating applications. Its non-sagging thixotropic consistency makes it suitable for:



- Military and aerospace electronics (e.g., modules, sensors)

- Industrial electronics (e.g., ruggedized controls, connectors)

- Automotive electronics (e.g., control units, sensitive components)




Its robust chemical resistance and moisture protection make it perfect for protecting sensitive components, especially where a thick or precise coating is required.




### Why choose HumiSeal® 1A33 GEL over other conformal coatings?


HumiSeal® 1A33 GEL is a single-component, urethane-based gel that provides excellent chemical and environmental resistance. It offers a thixotropic (non-flowing) consistency for applications like dam-and-fill, encapsulating components, or creating a specific high-build protective layer. It is compliant with MIL-I-46058C and RoHS 2011/65/EU directive. The gel fluoresces under UV light to enable easy inspection of coverage. It is applied by dispensing, syringe, or hand-applied methods, offering flexibility for various production processes. Its curing process allows for efficient manufacturing cycles, and it's a great choice for targeted protection.






### What is the shelf life of HumiSeal® 1A33 GEL?


HumiSeal® 1A33 GEL has a shelf life of 24 months from the date of manufacture when stored sealed at room temperature (0 to 35°C). Before use, allow the product to reach room temperature for optimal dispensing performance.




### How should I clean tools after applying HumiSeal® 1A33 GEL?


For coating removal during rework, use HumiSeal® Stripper 1063. Always ensure proper ventilation and use lint-free cloths during cleaning.






### What happens to HumiSeal® 1A33 GEL after its shelf life?


After the shelf life, viscosity and curing characteristics may degrade, potentially leading to inconsistent dispensing or reduced protective performance. Use of expired material is not recommended as it may compromise coating quality.




### How do curing times vary for HumiSeal® 1A33 GEL?


Curing times depend on temperature and humidity. A full cure can be achieved in 30 days at room temperature (25°C, 50% RH). Curing can be accelerated by heating, which may require specific temperature profiles for thicker applications to ensure a full and uniform cure.






### What is the recommended thickness for HumiSeal® 1A33 GEL?


Due to its thixotropic nature, HumiSeal® 1A33 GEL is designed for applications where high-build or encapsulated thicknesses are required, typically ranging from 20 to 100 mils (500 to 2500 microns). This is significantly thicker than standard conformal coatings and allows for dam-and-fill applications and glob topping.




### What are the differences between application methods for HumiSeal® 1A33 GEL?


HumiSeal® 1A33 GEL is applied by dispensing, syringe, or hand-applied methods due to its gel-like consistency. These methods are preferred for precise, high-build applications or for coating around components. Unlike liquid coatings, it is not suitable for spraying or dipping.






### What is the maximum operating temperature for HumiSeal® 1A33 GEL?


HumiSeal® 1A33 GEL is an evolution of the 1A33 chemistry, and it withstands thermal shock from –65°C to +125°C as per MIL-I-46058C testing. Continuous operation above 125°C is not recommended as it may degrade coating integrity.




### What safety precautions should I take when using HumiSeal® 1A33 GEL?


Use in well-ventilated areas and avoid open flames due to flammable solvents. Prevent skin and eye contact by wearing appropriate protective equipment. Consult the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for detailed handling and disposal instructions.






### How can I ensure proper application of HumiSeal® 1A33 GEL?


The gel fluoresces under UV light, allowing easy inspection of coverage and uniformity, which is critical for high-reliability electronics manufacturing, especially for ensuring full component coating.




### How does HumiSeal® 1A33 GEL perform in harsh environments?


HumiSeal® 1A33 GEL provides exceptional protection against moisture, chemicals, salt spray, and fungus. Its unique thixotropic consistency allows for a thick, non-flowing barrier, making it particularly effective in maintaining performance in humid, corrosive, and mechanically stressful environments. It is well-suited for military, aerospace, automotive, and industrial applications.
