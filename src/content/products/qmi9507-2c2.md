shortDescription: "LOCTITE ABLESTIK QMI9507-2C2 is developed as a soft solder alternative for applications requiring high thermal or high electrical conductivity. It contains spacers for improved bondline control. The optimized loading percentage is such that other bulk properties of the material remain unaffected. This product and its use may be covered by patent 5,716,034 and by one or more pending patent applications. LOCTITE ABLESTIK QMI9507-2C2 has a proprietary hybrid chemistry that can be heat cured or snap cured. It's spacer size is ~50um and is typically used for the attachment of intergrated circuits and components to metallic leadframes. It can be used on a wide variety of substrates such as metals, Ceramic surfaces, Copper, Ni/Pd/Au, Alloy 42 leadframes and Silver-plated copper leadframes. LOCTITE ABLESTIK QMI9507-2C2 is designed to achieve UPHs several orders of magnitude higher than conventional oven cured adhesives. Maximum productivity is realized through in-line cure, either on the diebonder using a post diebond heater or on the wirebonder preheater. Oven Cure 30 minutes @ 185°C Snap Cure 7-Zone Oven: Temp per zone: 170ºC, 170ºC, 170ºC, 190ºC, 190ºC, 190ºC, 190ºC Time per zone, seconds 10"
