apiId: 6893
name: LOCTITE FP4804 | Epoxy Underfill
slug: fp4804
sku: FP4804
brand: CAPLINQ
category: underfills
subcategory: underfills
sellingPoints:
  - Good flowability
  - Low CTE/modulus (reduced stress)
  - No resin bleed out on glass
shortDescription: LOCTITE ECCOBOND FP 4804 is a high-performance, silver-free epoxy underfill material developed to deliver improved adhesion and reduced stress in electronic packaging. Based on the same chemistry as the popular FP4802, FP 4804 builds on its predecessor with a higher filler content (78%), resulting in a significantly lower coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and modulus—crucial for minimizing thermal stress. With a cohesive failure mode in die shear testing and zero resin bleed on glass substrates, LOCTITE ECCOBOND FP 4804 ensures high-reliability bonding and a clean finish, even in precision applications. It also features a robust dispense profile that remains stable during extended work periods, making it ideal for use with jet dispensing systems. Applications Underfill for flip-chip and BGA components Semiconductor packaging requiring high adhesion and low CTE Automotive-grade electronics meeting AEC Grade 1 standards Jet dispensing processes for fine-feature electronics

Thawing (if applicable) 1. Allow container to reach room temperature before use. 2. After removing from freezer, set the syringes to stand vertically while thawing. 3. Do not open the container before contents reach 22°C temperature. Moisture that collects on the thawed container should be removed prior to opening the container. 4. Do not re-freeze. Once thawed to 22°C, the adhesive should not be re-frozen.
