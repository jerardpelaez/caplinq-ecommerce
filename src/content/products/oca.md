shortDescription: "LINQTAPE OCA is a film made out of Optically Clear Adhesive (OCA) backed on a PET substrate. OCA is a double-sided adhesive tape that is matrix-free, meaning it contains no supporting material. LINQTAPE OCA has exceptional high visible light transmittance and low resistivity, making OCA film one of the most versatile and high-performance conductive materials available. Applications include: Transparent device bonding: With exceptional light transmittance of up to 91%, our OCA Film guarantees crystal-clear visibility within the visible spectral region. Display assembly: With exceptional light transmittance of up to 91%, our OCA Film guarantees crystal-clear visibility within the visible spectral region. Areospace and militairy optic assembly: With exceptional light transmittance of up to 91%, our OCA Film guarantees crystal-clear visibility within the visible spectral region. Lenses: With exceptional light transmittance of up to 91%, our OCA Film guarantees crystal-clear visibility within the visible spectral region."
