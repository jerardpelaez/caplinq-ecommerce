  - Proven choice for coating of package leads and terminals
shortDescription: "LINQALLOY Sn100 Pure Tin (4N) Solder Spheres are Pb-free, Pure Tin (99.9928%) solder spheres for applications requiring pure tin solder spheres. Pure Tin is used for several applications, the most important of which is electroplating. Pure tin is a proven choice for the coating of package leads and terminals and it enables drop-in replacements for devices using lead-alloy (Pb) plating. Each jar has a clear label on the lid specifying the solder ball diameter as well as a label on the front identifying the alloy type, the quantity of spheres in the jar, the date of manufacture, and the product lot (or batch) number. This batch number is also tied to a certificate of conformance that is also provided with the solder spheres and ensures the Sn100 solder spheres meet the following quality criteria: Tin (Sn): 99.9928% Melting Temperature (Eutectic): 232&deg;C Sphericity: Within 1.5% Diameter Tolerance 0.1mm - 0.25mm (100&micro;m - 250&micro;m) : &plusmn; 0.0050mm (&plusmn; 5&micro;m) 0.3mm - 0.45mm (300&micro;m - 450&micro;m) : &plusmn; 0.010mm (&plusmn; 10&micro;m) 0.5mm - 0.89mm (500&micro;m - 890&micro;m) : &plusmn; 0.020mm ( &plusmn; 20&micro;m)"

What the "4N" stands for in the Pure Tin (4N) is the level of purity of the tin solder spheres. The specification used to determine this level of purity is defined by the maximum levels of impurities allowed. These levels of impurities are defined as follows:

### Metal Loading:

- Tin (Sn) : 99.9928% min

- Iron (Fe) : 0.0004% max

- Arsenic (As) : 0.0012% max

- Zinc (Zn) : 0.0002% max

- Bismuth (Bi) : 0.0004% max

- Copper (Cu) : 0.0004% max

- Antimony (Sb) : 0.0005% max

- Cobalt (Co) : 0.0002% max

- Aluminium (Al) : 0.0002% max

- Nickel (Ni) : 0.0008% max

- Lead (Pb) : 0.0018% max

- Cadmium (Cd) : 0.0002% max

- Indium (In) : 0.0004% max

- Silver (Ag) : 0.0004% max

- Sulfer (S) : 0.0001% max

### What do I get when I buy Sn100 Solder Spheres from CAPLINQ?

The advantage of ordering solder spheres online at CAPLINQ.com is that you can be sure of the quality. The solder spheres you receive are originally manufactured solder spheres packed into jars with inert gas (nitrogen). We do not repack the solder balls we receive, so the jars you will receive have never been opened, thus ensuring the quality of the product you receive. The lid of the jar is also always sealed with a shrink-wrapped plastic wrap ensuring that the solder spheres do not oxidate in the jar.
