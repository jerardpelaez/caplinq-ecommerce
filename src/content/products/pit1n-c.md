shortDescription: LINQTAPE PIT1N-C is a Clear Kapton, Polyimide film whose high-performance, flexible, high-temperature resistant polyimide film is used for many high-temperature applications. Polyimide is preferred over polyester for many high temperature applications. These applications include but are not limited to semiconductor, smartcard, electronic, automotive and general manufacturing industries. LINQTAPE PIT1N-C optically clear polyimide film is made from high-quality polyimide resin, which provides excellent mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties. This film is extremely durable and can withstand high temperatures up to 400°C without compromising its optical clarity or performance. The optically clear nature of this film makes it perfect for use in applications where visual clarity is essential. Its transparency allows for good light transmission, making it an excellent choice for displays, touchscreens, and other optical components. Additionally, the film's high clarity makes it a suitable option for use in optical sensors and imaging systems, where precise visual information is critical. Beyond its optical properties, our optically clear polyimide film also provides excellent thermal stability, making it ideal for use in high-temperature environments. Its thermal conductivity is excellent, which allows it to dissipate heat effectively, making it an excellent option for thermal management applications. LINQTAPE PIT1N-C is available in a range of thicknesses, widths, and lengths to meet your specific application needs. It is easy to handle, cut, and process, making it a versatile option for a wide range of industrial and consumer applications.
