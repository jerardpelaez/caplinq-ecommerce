The trace below indicates a calculated “onset” of cure at about 158°C. But the cure starts below that – typically 30°C for this type of chemistry – and we know from long experience with 968-2 that the cure starts happily at 125°C.

### Are you having issues with leakage?


Even this is not to be expected, air pressure within the package could lead to some leakage in certain configurations. In this case there are some solutions that you can consider.



- Vent hole: The “optimum” solution is to introduce a vent-hole. Either a small hole in the package, or an incomplete dispensed ring of 968-2. Then “plug” the hole after the 968-2 is cured. This can be done with a small amount of low temperature cure epoxy, or a UV/thermal dual-cure adhesive (eg NCA2280). Yes – the “plug” represents a potential weak point in the structure. However, it is a very small volume of material. If a filled adhesive is used, the CTE could be similar to the 968-2 and the very small volume will give low outgassing. Products like Eccobond 45 & Eccobond 104 & Stycast 2850FT might be worth a try.

- Optimize curing: It might be possible to optimise the 968-2 sealing with a slower of faster temperature ramp during cure. This would need to be determined experimentally. A very slow ramp rate from 25°C to the cure temperature might allow the air to diffuse through the glue, without moving the glue.

- Higher viscosity pastes: Products such as 968-4 with higher viscosity can help withstand the air pressure better and prevent any leakage.
