shortDescription: "LINQSOL LCP-GF30 is a liquid crystal polymer (LCP) reinforced with 30% glass fiber, offering an remarkable balance of mechanical properties, thermal stability, and chemical resistance. LCP-GF30 has greater strength and stiffness compared to unfilled LCP, making it suitable for demanding applications requiring precision and durability such as in electronics, aerospace, and automotive industries. Key Features and Benefits: Superior Mechanical Properties: The 30% glass fiber reinforcement increases the material's tensile strength, flexural modulus, and impact resistance, allowing for the production of robust and reliable parts. Excellent Thermal Stability: LCPs are known for their high heat resistance, and this reinforced grade further enhances this property, enabling it to withstand high temperatures for extended periods. This makes it suitable for high-temperature environments and demanding processing conditions. Exceptional Dimensional Stability: LCPs exhibit minimal shrinkage and warpage, ensuring tight tolerances and dimensional accuracy in molded parts. The glass fiber reinforcement further contributes to this stability. Excellent Chemical Resistance: This material is resistant to a wide range of chemicals, including acids, bases, and solvents, making it suitable for harsh environments. High Flowability: Despite the glass fiber reinforcement, this LCP retains good flow properties, allowing for the production of complex parts with intricate details."
