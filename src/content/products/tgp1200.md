shortDescription: Honeywell's TGP1200 has a very competitive cost of ownership and is ideal for not extremely demanding applications. It is naturally tacky, and requires no additional adhesive which could inhibit thermal performance. Honeywell's TGP1200 Thermal Gap Pads (TGP) provide high thermal performance with ease of use across a multitude of applications. Their ultra-high compressibility enables low stress and excellent conformity to mating surfaces. They are designed to minimize thermal resistance at interfaces, and maintain excellent performance through reliability testing. Products have very low hardness and are available in a thickness range from 0.5mm to 5.0mm with 0.25mm intervals.
