shortDescription: "LINQBOND ED-490CM is a high-performance, two-component epoxy adhesive designed for rapid curing at low temperatures making it ideal for fast-paced manufacturing processes. Its easy handling and excellent adhesion to various substrates streamline application without compromising on durability. With high toughness, low thermal stress, and superior thermal shock resistance, LINQBOND ED-490CM provides strong, resilient bonds even under temperature fluctuations. It also offers reliable electrical insulation under high humidity, making it well-suited for electronics and moisture-prone settings. The hardener in LINQBOND ED-490CM is specially formulated to prevent the formation of insoluble white solids when exposed to air, and the cured adhesive maintains a smooth, glossy, oil-free finish. Key Features: Durable: Exhibits excellent toughness, low thermal stress, and exceptional resistance to thermal shock. Reliable Electrical Insulation: Maintains outstanding electrical insulation properties, even under high humidity conditions. User-Friendly Hardener: The hardener is formulated to resist forming precipitates upon air exposure."

Directions for Use



- Weight the appropriate portions of Parts A & B. Ensure that the weight is well within the 2% tolerance. Mix thoroughly and scrape the walls of the container until a homogenous mixture is observed.

- The bonding surfaces should be clean, dry, and properly primed.

- For maximum adhesive quality, use ED-490CM before the indicated pot life. Large quantity is not recommended.

- For maximum bond strength, apply even quantities of the adhesive to both surfaces to be joined together.

- Cure time depends on several factors such as part geometry, materials to be bonded together, and thickness of adhesive added. Cure schedule should be in accordance with the production parts & equipment.
