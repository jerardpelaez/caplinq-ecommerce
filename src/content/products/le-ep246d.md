name: OPTOLINQ LE-EP246D | Optically Transparent Epoxy Resin
slug: le-ep246d
sku: LE-EP246D
brand: CAPLINQ
category: optically-clear-materials
subcategory: optically-clear-materials
sellingPoints:
  - Low working time and viscosity
  - Perfect surface gloss
  - Good chemical resistance
shortDescription: OPTOLINQ LE-EP246D is a two-component, low viscosity epoxy with excellent handling properties, chemical resistance, and high-gloss finish. It is ideal for potting, casting, sealing, encapsulation, and adhesive applications in electronic components, as well as for general industrial uses requiring extended work life. The hardener of LE-EP246D does not form insoluble, white solids even after being exposed to air. The cured surface remains oil-free while maintaining excellent gloss retention. Additionally, OPTOLINQ LE-EP246D offers excellent electrical insulation properties under high humidity conditions, withstands exposure to a wide range of chemicals and solvents, and complies to RoHS 2011/65/EU Directive. Applications Potting, casting, and encapsulation of electronic components General industrial sealing and coating applications Adhesive for transparent, chemical-resistant assemblies Applications requiring extended work life, chemical resistance, and optical clarity
