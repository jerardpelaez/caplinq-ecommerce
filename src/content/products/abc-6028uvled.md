shortDescription: ABChimie&reg; 6028UV LED is a transparent thixotropic resin coating designed to provide mechanical and environmental protection to electronic components and assemblies. Its thixotropic quality allows for controlled application with high thicknesses (up to 4mm) without sagging. This makes it ideal for encapsulation or localized protection. ABChimie&reg; 6028UV LED is acrylic-based and has excellent adhesion to many substrates, including flexible ones like plastics. One of its advantages is that it cures rapidly under UV LED light (395nm), has zero VOCs, and can be applied to high-speed manufacturing processes to increase productivity. ABChimmie 6028UV LED is in full compliance with REACH and RoHS regulations. Product Key Features Transparent, thixotropic UV-curing resin Allows for thick, controlled application without sagging Fast UV cure for high-sp Solvent-free formulation (no VOCs) LED light cure for environmental / worker safety Applications Encapsulation of electronic components requiring high volumes, localized protection, and a thick coating Sensors on PCBs, wire-bonded chips, and reinforcement of solder joints. Can be used to seal plastic casings on PCBs Printed circuit assemblies.

LED UV-Curable Resin Solutions

## ABChimie&reg; 6028 UV LED: Advanced Electronics Protection

 

ABChimie&reg; 6028 UV LED is a high-performance LED UV-curable resin designed to protect printed circuit board assemblies (PCBs) and components in demanding manufacturing environments. It delivers rapid curing, excellent electrical insulation, and thixotropic properties for precise, high-thickness application.

UV Curing Performance

Cures rapidly under 395nm LED light, enabling seamless integration into high-throughput batch and inline production lines without the thermal stress of mercury lamps.

Mechanical Protection

Achieves a Shore D hardness of 45, providing a durable barrier that resists scratches, abrasion, and minor impacts for long-term component stability.

Thixotropic Application

Maintains a stable, non-running consistency at rest while flowing easily under shear. Allows for deposits up to 4mm without sagging or running.

Substrate Versatility

Bonds strongly to flexible substrates, plastics, and polymer-based PCBs, ensuring protection on assemblies that bend, flex, or experience vibration.

Engineering Takeaway: It is crucial to use a 395nm LED lamp with a minimum UVA dose of 5000 mJ/cm&sup2; for a 1mm thickness to achieve the specified protective properties.

#### Emission Spectrum vs. Relative Power

Relative Power (%) over Wavelength (nm) for LED 395nm.

#### Key Curing Parameters

**Lamp Type:** LED
**Spectrum:** 395 nm
**Min UVA2 Dose:** 5000 mJ/cm&sup2;
**Max Depth:** Up to 4 mm

*Higher UVA doses do not negatively affect final properties.
