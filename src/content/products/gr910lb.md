shortDescription: "Hysol GR910-LB is a high-performance, epoxy-based encapsulant meticulously engineered to meet the stringent requirements of Ball Grid Array (BGA) Thin Factor (TF) card applications. With electronics trending toward smaller and thinner designs, GR910-LB delivers the durability and protective performance needed to ensure long-term reliability in ultra-compact packages. Its advanced formulation offers robust thermal and mechanical properties, protecting delicate interconnects and microstructures from environmental stress, thermal cycling, and mechanical strain. Whether used in consumer electronics, telecommunications, or high-density computing modules, Hysol GR910-LB provides critical reinforcement and peace of mind. Product Key Features: Superior Moisture Resistance: GR910-LB shields sensitive semiconductor components from moisture ingress, a critical factor in maintaining the integrity and functionality of small form-factor devices operating in diverse environments. Excellent Flowability and Fill: This molding compound ensures complete and void-free encapsulation of intricate BGA packages, even with tight pin pitches and complex geometries. This leads to enhanced mechanical strength and improved heat dissipation. Low Stress and Warpage: GR910-LB minimizes stress on the delicate silicon die and substrate during the molding and curing process, significantly reducing the risk of warpage and ensuring reliable electrical connections. Halogen-Free Formulation: Environmentally conscious and compliant with industry regulations, our molding compound is halogen-free, contributing to sustainable manufacturing practices. Exceptional Electrical Insulation: Provides robust electrical insulation, preventing short circuits and ensuring the stable operation of the BGA TF card. Hysol GR910-LB is available in different sizes. Contact us for more information."
