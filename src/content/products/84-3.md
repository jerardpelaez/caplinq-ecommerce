shortDescription: LOCTITE ABLESTIK 84-3 non conductive adhesive is designed for medium size die attach and assembly applications. This adhesive is ideal for application by automatic dispensing, screen printing or hand. It has fairly high viscosity and can be applied by dispense or print while also resisting air expansion. Additionally, it is epoxy-based, so should bond well to almost any surface. It's poison ration is estimated at ±0.3 which is typical for epoxy adhesives. LOCTITE ABLESTIK 84-3 is based on the tried and true 84-1LMI chemistry, has a well defined operating temperature range and is well accepted in military/defense applications for several years. It meets the requirements of MIL-STD-883, Method 5011 and passes NASA outgassing standards if cured properly but is epoxy based and is unlikely to survive the AuSn reflow process. The weight loss of 84-3 at 300 °C is only 0.17%, but the properties, performance, and reliability after the AuSn reflow profile would have to be tested. Cure Schedule 1 hour @ 150°C 2 hours @ 125°C
