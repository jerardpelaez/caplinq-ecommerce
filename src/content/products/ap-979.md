shortDescription: "Kester 979 is a VOC-free, no-clean flux formulated for producing high-quality, low-defect solder joints on electronic circuit board assemblies. Its advanced, finely tuned activation system delivers the best wetting performance available in VOC-free liquid flux technology, resulting in the shiniest solder joints possible. Product Key Features Contains no volatile organic compounds for a safer workplace and reduced environmental impact. Superior wetting & joint appearance Leaves a minimal amount of residue after soldering, which is non-corrosive, non-conductive, and does not require removal Does not attack properly cured solder masks or standard FR-4 Epoxy-Glass laminate materials. Applications Wave soldering & selective soldering Processes requiring low-residue fluxes Note: Not compatible for use in a soldering process that does not have a preheat cycle associated with it, such as soldering with an iron."

### Flux Application

Kester 979 can be applied to circuit boards by a spray, foam, or dip process. Flux deposition should be 120 to 240ug of solids/cm2 (750 to 1500ug of solids/in2). An air knife after the flux tank is recommended to remove excess flux from the circuit board and prevent dripping on the preheater surface. 979 does not work in foam application.
