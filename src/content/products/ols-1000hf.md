shortDescription: OPTOLINQ OLS-1000HF is a two-part (Part A & Part B), optically clear epoxy casting compound designed for the encapsulation of LED lamps and displays. It features excellent UV resistance, high optical transmittance, good adhesion to a range of substrates, and good thermal shock resistance. It is geared specifically for applications that will not be exposed to temperatures above 125 °C, and where the cost of the encapsulation material is a large percentage of the final part cost. The OLS-1000HF is the Low Halogen version of OLS-1000. OPTOLINQ OLS-1000HF has been used extensively for low-power LED encapsulation, automatic LED casting, and potting of large optoelectronic modules. Each of these applications relies on the high clarity and other optical properties of the OLS-1000HF as well as its excellent mechanical properties. The OLS-1000 can be colored and diffused by the addition of specific dye concentrates and diffusant concentrates. This product is not made for SMD encapsulation but mainly for DIP packages.

### Processing Instructions



Pre-heat agent A at 45–60 °C for a maximum of 4 h, depending on the temperature and season.


Mix components A and B in a certain proportion and stir uniformly.


Defoam the mixture.


Curing conditions :



- Size Φ3: First cure at 130–135 °C/1 h, followed by post cure at 130–135 °C/6–8 h.

- Size Φ5: First cure at 125–130 °C/1 h, followed by post cure at 130–135 °C/6–8 h.

- Sizes Φ8, Φ10: First cure at 105–120 °C/1 h, followed by post cure at 130–135 °C/6–8 h.

### Using Additives


Optolinq OLS-1000HF can be mixed with diffusing agents or color pastes to achieve customer-specific purposes.


Recommended quantity (in weight %) of various diffusing agents and color pastes to be used with OLS-1000HF:



- OCP01-R Red Color Paste: 2-5% by weight

- OCP01-B Blue Color Paste: 1-3% by weight

- OCP01-G Green Color Paste: 2-4% by weight

- ODF-10 Diffusing Agent: 2-5% by weight




Values with our latest pastes and agents TBD.


### Storage and Handling


OPTOLINQ OLS-1000HF is supplied in cans and jars and should be kept in a cool (10°C – 25°C) dry place (40% – 75% humidity) away from direct sunlight or temperature extremes. Part B is particularly sensitive to moisture, so be sure to remove moisture after using and to keep the lid of the container tightly sealed after use.


Under these conditions, the shelf life of Part A is 6 months and the shelf life of Part B is 3 months. The data contained herein may be reported as typical value and/or range values based on actual test data and are verified on a periodic basis.
