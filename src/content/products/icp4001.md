name: LOCTITE ABLESTIK ICP 4001
slug: icp4001
sku: ICP4001
brand: CAPLINQ
category: electrically-conductive-adhesives
subcategory: electrically-conductive-adhesives
sellingPoints:
  - Low outgassing
  - Low stress interconnects
  - Noble components on noble LF
shortDescription: "LOCTITE® ABLESTIK ICP 4001 Ag filled, silicone-based, one component, electrically conductive adhesive is recommended for use in attaching devices or mount components in circuit assembly applications. It is specifically designed to provide reliable low stress interconnects exposed to prolonged vibrational energy and high operating temperatures. LOCTITE® ABLESTIK ICP 4001 has been optimised to maintain its flexibility and survive at operating temperatures as high as 200ºC. it has low outgassing and low bleeding during cure. Compared to ICP 4000 it has better adhesion but slightly worse electrical performance. LOCTITE® ABLESTIK ICP 4001 common applications include and are not limited to: Bonding of noble passive components onto noble terminated lead frames for electronic sensors Back contact bonding of c-Si PV cells to conductive Ag tracks Cure Schedule 35 minutes @ 140°C"

DMA Analysis


CTE is always the one above Tg as the Tg is always so low in these products that a decent measurement below that temperature is almost impossible with our machines.
