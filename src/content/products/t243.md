sellingPoints:
  - Improved oil resistance
  - Non-migrating, thick forumation
  - Good chemical resistance
shortDescription: LINQBOND T243 is medium strength, general purpose, removable threadlocker with improved oil resistance for fasteners bettween 1/4" and 3/4" (6 to 20 mm) diameters. LINQBOND T243 is a medium viscosity anaerobic adhesive with medium to high strength threadlocking adhesives for ferrous and non-ferrous threaded fasteners. Cured performance is consistent with other industrial fastener finishes such as black oxide and zinc plated steel. LINQBOND T243 has good solvent resistance against most industrial solvents. It can be used with most industrial lubricants, oils, and cleaners with minimal pre-cleaning. It works on most metal surfaces including oily steel, stainless steel, aluminum, and zinc-plated metals. It is also formulated to provide a consistent torque-tension relationship across the recommended torque range for grade 5 fasteners. LINQBOND T243 is stronger and cures faster than LINQBOND T242.

Directions for Use

- Apply adhesive to the male thread. The area does not need to be fully covered with the adhesive to achieve good locking torque.

- Assemble the male and female threads together. Tighten to the desired torque within 5 minutes of assembly.

Curing Information

- Fixture Time: 15-20 mins on zinc. 5-8 minutes on steel and black oxide finishes

- Full strength: 24 hours
