shortDescription: "LINQSOL™ EMC-G274 is a halogen-free epoxy molding compound engineered for photocoupler/optocoupler devices. It offers excellent moldability (spiral flow of 105 cm at 175 °C), low moisture absorption ( 0.5% PCT 24 h), and superior mechanical strength (flexural strength = 160 MPa). With a glass transition of 147 °C ensures reliability in high-stress, high-temperature environments. Its factor in low ion content and high volume resistivity makes it ideal for sensitive optoelectronic applications. LINQSOL EMC-G274 guarantees strong performance and outstanding long-term reliability in demanding environments. This product is deliberately formulated without the inclusion of substances prohibited by the European Union RoHS and REACH. Overall, EMC-G274 seamlessly integrates advanced material properties, safety compliance, and superior performance to deliver a reliable solution for semiconductor device encapsulation. LINQSOL EMC-G274 is available in custom pellet dimensions. Contact us for specifications. Key Features Fast Gel & High Flowability – 27 s gel time, 105 cm spiral flow at 175 °C: enables efficient molding cycles. High Tg (147 °C) – Maintains dimensional and thermal stability under elevated temperature. Low Moisture Absorption (0.5%) – Enhances reliability by mitigating “popcorn” cracking in moisture-sensitive devices. Strong Mechanical Integrity (160 MPa) – Delivers robust package strength and resistance to mechanical stress. High Electrical Insulation – Volume resistivity 8 × 10¹⁵ Ω·cm ensures excellent dielectric performance. UL‑94 V‑0 Flame Resistance – Complies with stringent flammability standards for electronic components. Ideal for photocoupler/optocoupler devices requiring: Reliable encapsulation in transfer molding applications Low-stress dielectric protection in optical signal pathways High-voltage isolation in light-transmitting packages Thermal cycling stability and moisture-resistant packaging"
