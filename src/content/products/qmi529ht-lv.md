shortDescription: LOCTITE® ABLESTIK QMI529HT-LV is a thermally and electrically conductive, hydrophobic die attach paste with good dispensing characteristics. It exhibits low moisture absorption, excellent adhesion and low stress while also being thermally stable at 260ºC reflow temperatures. QMI529HT-LV has great adhesion on lower temperatures works great on PPF, Ag/Au finish and while it does work on Ni finish, a more custom curing schedule might be required. LOCTITE® ABLESTIK QMI529HT-LV can be dispensed on a faster rate and is considered an upgraded version of QMI 529HT. Its excellent workability, low stress, low RBO and high reliability make it a flexible product that can also work great in Optical sensor ASIC attach. Its maximum particle size is 40um. Epoxy systems need a needle size ~5 times bigger than the max particle size therefore a ~150-200um needle would be a good starting point. LOCTITE® ABLESTIK QMI529HT-LV conductive die attach adhesive has been formulated for use in high throughput die attach applications and successfully passes NASA outgassing, MIL-STD-883 and Method5011 standards. It has been tested in 5x5mm die and it has demonstrated exceptional die shear strength @ 270°C after being cured for 60m at 190°C. Cure Schedule 30 minute ramp to 175°C + 1 hour @ 175°C

### Recommended cure profile for QMI 529HT-LV


Curing instructions might vary per product and customer application. Some general guidelines that have worked in the past are the following:



- Make sure to have a good build quality (especially bondline thickness) to get good temp cycling and reliability

- Adhesion to Nickel can be tough, "roughened" surfaces can help with better adhesion

- 35min ramp up to 170°C (if you can go up to 175°C you should)

- Hold for 2hrs @ 170°C (up to 4hrs could have a slightly more positive effect)

### Do die attach pastes work on Silicon and Silicone?


First of all, there’s a big difference between Silicon (Si, inorganic) and Silicone (organic). It's a common misconception and typo, but a very crucial one. All die attach products are designed to have good adhesion for Silicon while almost nothing will stick to silicone, except silicone.


If the substrate is also Silicon (Si), this means no or minimum CTE mismatch vs Si, GaN and SiC die material and so no flexibility is needed. Die attach materials are typically used for bonding Si die on Cu lead frame or laminate substrates with more than 5 times the CTE of Silicon, so bonding on Si is definitely easier and less stressful.
