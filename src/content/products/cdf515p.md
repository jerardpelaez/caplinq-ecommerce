shortDescription: LOCTITE ABLESTIK CDF 515P, highly filled, conductive die attach adhesive is designed to provide high thermal and electrical conductivity in the attachment of integrated circuits and components onto metal leadframes. This adhesive exhibits strong adhesion to various wafer metallizations and leadframe finishes. It can be used in a variety of die sizes ranging from 3mm x 3mm to 8mm x 8mm . LOCTITE ABLESTIK CDF 515P offers high MSL reliability, controlled fillet size and does not exhibit resin bleed out. It has good wetting and low warpage on large dies and is recommended for thin wafer handling applications. It comes in 15 and 30um and is typically used for QFN, TQFP and eTQFP package applications.

Films work like the “household double sided tape”. We can quickly appreciate the benefit as we used a dry resin for this, that results in a no mess assembly and very even BLT. Standard thickness of our films is 15um and 30um.


If your Z-space is really critical and has to have a very low BLT, Film is the way to go. Yes, there will be the additional process of laminating the film underneath you wafers but after that its all the same as traditional die attach process.
