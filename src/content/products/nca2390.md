Recommended Primary UV Cure



 High pressure mercury lamp:



- UV Wavelength, nm: 365

- Light Intensity, mW/cm²: 700 - 1,000

- Exposure Time, seconds: 3







Recommended Secondary Thermal Cure Schedule



- 30 minutes @ 80°C (not including ramp up time)

- Alternate cure shedule: 60 minutes @ 75°C (not including ramp up time)




Thawing



- Allow container to reach room temperature before use.

- After removing from the freezer, set the syringes to stand vertically while thawing.

- DO NOT open the container before contents reach 25°C temperature. Any moisture that collects on the thawed container should be removed prior to opening the container.

- DO NOT re-freeze. Once thawed to 25°C, the adhesive should not be re-frozen.




Directions for Use



- Complete cleaning of the substrates should be performed to remove contamination such as oxide layers, dust, moisture, salt and oils which can cause poor adhesion or corrosion in a bonded part.

- Apply adhesive to all surfaces to be bonded and join together.
