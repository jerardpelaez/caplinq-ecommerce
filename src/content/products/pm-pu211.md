shortDescription: "LINQBOND PM-PU211 is a two-component flame retardant polyurethane material engineered for wide applications such as bonding of pre-treated materials, potting, and encapsulation. PM-PU211 system is composed of naturally occurring hydroxyl resin and isocyanate-based hardener, exhibiting rigid elastomer properties upon curing. LINQBOND PM-PU211 passed HWI, HAI and CTI tests with PLC 0 rating and relative thermal index (RTI) value of >105°C. Additionally, with a UL 94 V-0 flammability rating and Class B insulation, PM-PU211 guarantees strong performance and outstanding reliability. This product is deliberately formulated without the inclusion of substances prohibited by the European Union RoHS and REACH. LINQBONDTM PM-PU211 seamlessly integrates into your projects, ensuring a smooth and reliable package. Viscosity and pot life of PM-PU211 can be adjusted to match the customer requirements. Key Features & Benefits : Superior Flame Retardancy (UL 94 V-0): Meets stringent fire safety standards for enhanced protection. High Thermal Index (RTI > 105°C): Maintains performance at elevated temperatures for long-term reliability. Excellent Electrical Insulation (Class B): Provides reliable electrical insulation for sensitive components. RoHS and REACH Compliant: Free from harmful substances, adhering to environmental regulations. Versatile Applications: Ideal for bonding, potting, and encapsulation of various materials. Strong Adhesion: Bonds effectively to pre-treated materials for durable and long-lasting assemblies. Low Mixed Viscosity (1200 ± 100 cP): Ensures excellent flowability for complete filling of complex shapes. Fast Cure Time: Rapid curing at room temperature for increased production efficiency. Applications: Bonding of pre-treated materials (e.g., metals, plastics) Potting and encapsulation of electronic components Cable joining and sealing"

Processing Instructions





Before mixing, stir both Part A and Part B to homogenize.




Mix components A and B according to the specified weight ratio. Stir thoroughly to ensure uniformity while preventing air from introduced into the mixture. Ensure contamination is avoided.




To ensure complete mixing of both parts, machine mixing and dispensing are recommended. Static and dynamic mixer can also be used for mixing.




Degas the mixture to remove the bubbles for about 10 minutes. Do not fill the container more than half full to prevent overflowing during degassing.




Gradually pour the mixed compound into the device being potted.




Allow the potted workpiece cure at 25°C until the surface is dry. Full curing typically occurs within 24 hours. The curing process is influenced by temperature variations; generally, higher temperatures result in faster curing, while lower temperatures lead to slower curing.







Precautions





Use the mixture promptly after combining components A and B to prevent a significant increase in viscosity.




If the components have been stored for an extended period and exhibit precipitation or stratification, they should be thoroughly mixed before use.







Packaging


Part A is available in 30 kg open top plastic bucket. Part B is available in 250 kg metal barrels or 40 and 24 kg plastic cans.


Storage and Handling


Store in a ventilated, dry, and clean environment at 25°C–40°C Keep away from fire and heat sources. It is strictly forbidden to store in outdoor environments. At proper storage conditions, Part A has a shelf life of 6 months and Part B has a shelf life of 12 months.




Please note that the provided information is based on available data and typical conditions. For specific applications and detailed test results, refer to the actual test data and conduct appropriate certification.
