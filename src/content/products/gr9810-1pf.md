shortDescription: Hysol GR9810-1PF is a heat curable, state of the art, black, semiconductor epoxy molding compound developed to meet the stringent encapsulation requirements of package on package (POP and SCSP). It is a Green, halogen free product with, excellent dimensional stability, very low mold shrinkage and High Tg. Its chemistry allows for properties that go far beyond the "Standard Green" compound ranges. Hysol GR9810-1PF and its related product GR9810-1P offer a new technology platform on which Hysol develops epoxy mold compounds for high reliability sensors and modules. Key features of GR9810-1PF are summarized as below. Reliability Improved adhesion promoter and toughening system High filler loading (>86%) for lower moisture uptake Reduced moisture uptake for best MSL performance (MSL1-3) Warpage Control Multifunctional resin hardener system with high Tg High cross-linking degree with special toughening system High filler loading for low CTE to minimize thermal mismatch High performance stress modifier to reduce internal stress Wire Sweep Control Optimized filler PSD with 75um (-1P) or 45um (-1PF) filler cut Low viscosity resin and latent catalyst for ultra long flow Hysol GR9810-1PF is developed for advanced reliability control. The goal of this technology platform is to introduce an epoxy mold compound capable of passing MSL1 260°C on some devices and at least MSL3 260°C on a stacked CSP (PoP) devices. The benefits do not stop here since this product is resistant to ATF (Automatic transmission fluid) and exhibits ultra low warpage making it an excellent choice for automotive packages. Check reliability test results and typical applications in automotive electronics.
