shortDescription: Silaplane® FM-3325 is a reactive polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) based polymer with a molecular weight of 10,000 g/mol and a Viscosity of 200 - 400 mPas. This reactive silicone material offers the addition of silicone-type properties to non-Silicone materials in a variety of industries including electronics, semiconductors, automotive, biotech, healthcare, and clean energy applications. It offers narrow polydispersity and a low level of chemical impurities. Silaplane® FM-3325 bi-terminal product has two Amino functional groups that are reactive toward a variety of compounds and surfaces enabling chemical and physical changes to chemicals, particle surfaces and larger surface structures. Hydroxy groups are mainly reactive with amides, imides and are suitable for epoxy curing.
