shortDescription: Linqsol BCP-1134 is a thermoplastic coating powder capable of achieving a breakdown voltage of up to 82 kV/mm. It is a semi-crystalline powder that exhibits excellent spray characteristics, and due to its good melt flow and low density is ideal for electrostatic spray and dip coating applications. A distinctive feature of Linqsol BCP-1134 is that it has a virtually infinite shelf life when stored at room temperature since cross-linking is not necessary for coating. It is very easy to apply, environmentally friendly, and great for applications where low coefficient of friction and good abrasion resistance are required. This thermoplastic is used in technical and functional applications, but due to its smooth coating also has decorative applications. The best results can be seen on copper, nickel-coated, and aluminum busbars, and since the BCP-1134 is reworkable, damages can be repaired with ease. Advantages of BCP-1134 Offers good impact resistance to stress cracking Great for spray applications High-temperature resistance Good oil resistance Excellent melt flow High flexural modulus
