Processing Instructions



- Before use, allow TMC-G373H to reach room temperature (20±5 °C, 40±15% RH) for a minimum of 24 hours for larger pellets and 12 hours for smaller ones, ensuring the bag remains unopened to prevent moisture contamination.

- For TMC-G373H in larger sizes, preheating can be performed using standard RF equipment. Preheating must be done slowly to achieve uniform temperature.

- Prior to molding with TMC-G373H or any new material, the mold should be cleaned thoroughly. To prepare the mold, the initial three shots should be cured for 5–10 minutes. After this initial preparation period, you can reduce the curing time to a level that provides sufficient hot hardness for effective release.




Storage and Handling


OPTOLINQ TMC-G373H is available in pressed pellets in a wide range of sizes to meet specific customer needs. To ensure product integrity, keep it away from oxidizing materials. For long-term storage, maintain a cold environment, ideally at –10 °C or lower. The shelf life under this condition is 6 months.
