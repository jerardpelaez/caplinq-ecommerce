sellingPoints:
  - High Thermal Conductivity
  - High Reliability
  - Pressureless sintering
shortDescription: LINQBONDTM DA-8410 is a silver sintering die attach paste with excellent adhesion on bare Cu substrates, as well as other metal plated substrates. Pressureless sintering is achieved at 250 °C, providing excellent adhesion and leaving no organic residues, resulting in high thermal conductivity and reliability. LINQBONDTM DA-8410 is designed as a die attach material for applications requiring high thermal and electrical conductivity. Typically used for high thermal resistance assemblies such as LEDs, laser diodes, RF devices, automotive electronics, and power devices.

Cure schedule


Two-Step Curing Conditions (refer to the diagram below):





1st step: 5 °C/min ramp to 80 °C and hold for 30 min




2nd step: 5 °C/min ramp from 80 °C to 250 °C and hold for 60 min




Cool down: 5 to 10 °C/min cool down to room temperature







Precautions for Use





Allow the container to reach room temperature before use. Syringe should be placed vertically while thawing. Thaw process for 10 cc syringe takes 1 hour.




The adhesive cannot be refrozen once exposed to room temperature.




To ensure uniform and stable viscosity, syringe can be placed in planetary mixer for 2 min at 800 rpm.




Please note that the provided information is based on available data and typical conditions. For specific applications and detailed test results, refer to the actual test data and conduct appropriate certifications.
