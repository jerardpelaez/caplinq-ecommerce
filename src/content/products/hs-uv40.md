## Frequently Asked Questions About HumiSeal® UV40



### What are typical applications for HumiSeal® UV40?




HumiSeal® UV40 is a versatile, high-performance UV curable conformal coating widely used for protecting printed circuit board assemblies (PCBs) across a broad range of industries, including:



- Military and aerospace electronics (e.g., avionics, control modules)

- Industrial electronics (e.g., motor drives, sensors)

- Automotive electronics (e.g., control units, electronic modules)

- Consumer electronics (e.g., communication devices, household electronics)

- Solar and photovoltaic systems (UV40-SOLAR variant)

- LED displays




Its excellent chemical resistance, surface hardness, flexibility, and moisture resistance make it ideal for harsh environments and mission-critical applications where fast processing and reliable protection are essential.




### Why choose HumiSeal® UV40 over other conformal coatings?




HumiSeal® UV40 is a single-component, high-solids, acrylated polyurethane formulation that provides excellent chemical and environmental resistance. It offers rapid tack-free curing under UV light, significantly accelerating production cycles. A unique secondary moisture cure mechanism ensures full curing of any unexposed "shadow areas" of the coating within 2-3 days at ambient conditions (which can be accelerated with heat and humidity). The coating fluoresces under UV light to enable easy inspection of coverage and uniformity. It is compliant with MIL-I-46058C, IPC-CC-830, RoHS Directive 2011/65/EC (and 2015/863/EU), and is UL recognized (UL File Number E105698). UV40 can be applied by selective coating equipment or conventional hand spray, offering flexibility for various production processes. You can learn how to select a conformal coating in our latest blog.






### What is the shelf life of HumiSeal® UV40?


HumiSeal® UV40 has a shelf life of 12 months from the date of manufacture when stored sealed in tightly closed opaque containers at 0 to 25°C, away from excessive heat and direct sunlight or full spectrum fluorescent lighting. Before use, allow the product to equilibrate for 24 hours at room temperature for optimal application performance. As UV40 is a moisture curing material, care should be taken to protect process vessels and partial containers from moisture by purging with a dry, inert gas (e.g., dry air, nitrogen, or argon) before closure.




### How should I clean tools after applying HumiSeal® UV40?


To flush equipment and clean uncured HumiSeal® UV40, non-alcohol based solvents should be used. HumiSeal® Thinner 521/521EU is recommended. For coating removal during rework, HumiSeal® UV40 is a highly cross-linked UV cured coating and is more difficult to remove than traditional coatings. Thermal displacement, mechanical abrasion and, where available, HumiSeal® Stripper 1100 are suitable options for rework of HumiSeal® UV40.






### What happens to HumiSeal® UV40 after its shelf life?


After the shelf life, viscosity and curing characteristics may degrade, potentially leading to uneven coating, reduced protective performance, or improper curing. Use of expired material is not recommended as it may compromise coating quality. Given its photosensitive and moisture-curing nature, proper storage is crucial to maintaining product integrity.




### How does HumiSeal® UV40 cure, and why do curing times vary?


HumiSeal® UV40 is a dual-cure coating. The primary cure is achieved rapidly through exposure to UV light, making the coating tack-free almost instantly. The required UV dose ranges from 1.5-3.0 J/cm² (UVA) and irradiance from 0.50-1.15 W/cm², depending on the UV system (arc or microwave, with "H" style bulbs recommended for microwave systems). Heat can also influence UV cure, with higher heat levels allowing for lower UV dose/irradiance. A secondary moisture cure mechanism is designed to fully cure any unexposed "shadow areas" within 2-3 days at ambient conditions. Due to variations in curing equipment and process conditions, it is strongly recommended to consult us for technical support on curing conditions.






### What is the recommended thickness for HumiSeal® UV40?


The recommended coating thickness for HumiSeal® UV40 is 25 to 125 microns (1-5 mils) to ensure optimal protection without compromising flexibility or electrical performance. The actual thickness will vary based on application equipment and process settings.




### What are the differences between application methods for HumiSeal® UV40?


HumiSeal® UV40 is best applied by standard selective coating equipment or conventional hand spray equipment for consistent, high-volume application. Brushing is suitable for rework or touch-up only, where the uniformity of the finished coating will depend on component density and operator technique. UV40 is generally not suitable for dipping applications. When spraying, the source air must be dry (a dry inert gas is highly recommended) to prevent premature curing of the secondary cure mechanism.






### What is the maximum operating temperature for HumiSeal® UV40?


HumiSeal® UV40 withstands thermal shock from –65°C to +125°C as per MIL-I-46058C testing. It has a continuous use operating range of -65°C to +125°C. Continuous operation at or above 135°C is generally the upper limit, as prolonged exposure to higher temperatures may degrade coating integrity.




### What safety precautions should I take when using HumiSeal® UV40?


Use in well-ventilated areas and avoid inhalation of vapors or spray. Prevent skin and eye contact by wearing appropriate protective equipment, including opaque gloves and UV-protective eyewear, due to its photosensitive nature. The product contains flammable solvents, so avoid open flames or sparks. Consult the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for detailed handling, storage, and disposal instructions. Ensure that product containers are tightly closed and opaque, and purge partial containers with dry inert gas to prevent premature polymerization.






### How can I ensure proper application of HumiSeal® UV40?


HumiSeal® UV40 fluoresces brightly under UV light, allowing for quick and easy visual inspection of coating coverage and uniformity. This feature is critical for ensuring proper application and quality control in high-reliability electronics manufacturing, making it simple to identify any missed areas or defects.




### How does HumiSeal® UV40 perform in harsh environments?


HumiSeal® UV40 provides excellent protection against moisture, chemicals, salt spray, and fungus (passes ASTM G21). Its highly cross-linked UV-cured film, combined with the secondary moisture cure, ensures robust performance and maintains integrity in humid, corrosive, and mechanically stressful environments, making it highly suitable for military, aerospace, automotive, and industrial applications.

### Advanced Dual-Cure Technology ⚡






HumiSeal® UV40 leverages a dual-cure system to ensure complete protection. Its primary cure occurs almost instantly under UV light, allowing for immediate handling and significantly boosting production line speed. This makes it ideal for high-volume manufacturing. For areas that UV light cannot reach (known as "shadow areas" under components), a secondary moisture cure mechanism ensures full cross-linking within 2-3 days at ambient conditions. This can be accelerated with mild heat (60-80°C) and humidity for faster full cure.


Curing Parameters:



- Primary UV Cure: Tack-free after exposure to UV light (1.5-3.0 J/cm² UVA, 0.50-1.15 W/cm² irradiance, depending on UV system). Microwave UV ovens with "H" style bulbs are recommended.

- Secondary Moisture Cure (for shadow areas): 2-3 days at ambient conditions, or 2-4 hours at 60-80°C with humidity.




This dual-cure capability provides robust and complete protection, even for complex geometries.




Application and Compatibility


UV40 is formulated for efficient application and broad compatibility, fitting seamlessly into modern manufacturing environments.


Compatible With:



- ✔ Standard selective coating equipment and hand spray methods

- ✔ High-reliability applications requiring excellent chemical and moisture resistance

- ✔ "No-clean" flux residues (users should confirm compatibility)

- ✔ Lead-free and RoHS-compliant manufacturing environments




Additionally, its UV fluorescence ensures easy inspection, and the coating is reworkable using thermal methods or mechanical abrasion—ideal for repairable designs and serviceable assemblies.
