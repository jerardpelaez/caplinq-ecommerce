### Processing Instructions



- Mix component A and B, stir uniformly, and degas under vacuum.

- Recommended molding curing conditions: Mold at 150 °C for 5 minutes and post-mold cure at 130–135 °C for 6–8 hours. Identify the specific curing settings based on your product requirements.




### Using Additives


Optolinq OLS-1557 can be mixed with diffusing agents or color pastes to achieve customer-specific purposes.


Recommended quantity of various diffusing agents and color pastes:



- OPC-R Red Color Paste: 0.1-0.5% by epoxy weight

- OPC-B Blue Color Paste: 0.1-0.5% by epoxy weight

- OPC-G Green Color Paste: 0.1-0.5% by epoxy weight

- ODF-090 Diffusing Agent: 3-5% by weight (LED lamps), 4-8% (LED displays)




### Storage and Handling


Store in a ventilated, dry, and clean environment below 30 °C and 70% RH. Keep away from fire and heat sources. It is strictly forbidden to store in outdoor environments. At proper storage conditions, Part A has a shelf life of 6 months and Part B a shelf life of 3 months. Shelf life can be extended by using cold storage.
