shortDescription: "LINQCELL GDP210-MP is a 0.21mm thick carbon paper with a Microporous layer and PTFE. It is commonly used as a gas diffusion layer and electrode for fuel cells. Its through-plane resistivity is around 7.8 mΩcm2. This carbon paper is highly flexible and has excellent air permeability. It can compress down to 160um at 3.5MPa (350 N/cm2). LINQCELL GDP210-MP is a close alternative to the discontinued Spectracarb 0850. There is also the option to make these with higher heat treatment as GDP210-MPS. This treatment reduces the resistivity and increases the compressibility of the sheets, for applications that require these properties. LINQCELL GDP210-MP is a 120-µm thick graphitized carbon fiber paper made from high-quality polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers. The fibers undergo a wet-laying process to form a non-woven, fibrous, and porous structure, which is then carbonized and graphitized. This high-temperature graphitization (1600 °C) results in high electrical conductivity, high oxidation resistance, and excellent thermal stability, making LINQCELL GDP210-MP highly recommended as gas diffusion layers in fuel cells. It can also be used as gas diffusion substrates for carbon dioxide electrolyzers. LINQCELL GDP210-MP has a microporous layer and PTFE coating, which provide hydrophobicity and increased surface area. The higher surface area maximizes catalyst utilization, which increases fuel cell efficiency. Meanwhile, the hydrophobic properties improve water removal and ensure stable operation by preventing flooding within the stack. Key Features: 210-µm Thickness: Optimized for reduced stack volume and internal resistance. High-Temperature Graphitization (2000 °C): Provides excellent electrical conductivity, oxidation resistance, and thermal stability. Microporous Layer & PTFE Coating: Enhances hydrophobicity, increases surface area, and optimizes catalyst utilization. Improved Water Management: Hydrophobic properties prevent flooding and ensure stable operation by enhancing water removal. High Compressibility and Porosity: Can be compressed down to 160 µm at 3.5 MPa (350 N/cm2) Highly Recommended As: Gas diffusion layers of fuel cells, particularly proton exchange membrane fuel cells Gas diffusion substrates of carbon dioxide electrolyzer electrodes For even better performance, LINQCELL GDP210-MP can be produced at a higher graphitization temperature (2000 °C): LINQCELL GDP210-MPS. LINQCELL GDP210-MP is available in sheet form only. LINQCELL Graphitized Carbon Fiber Papers with MPL and PTFE treatment are offered in a standard width of 40 cm.

### I see a checkered pattern on the sheet. Is this relevant to MD/XD?


The checkered pattern of GDP210-MP is caused by the mesh pad that is used to apply the hydrophobic layer. This has no effect on the products' strength or mechanical characteristics. Generally, the hydrophobic surface will face up, and the other side will not have this pattern. Sometimes we tend to use a felt pad instead of a mesh, as with GPD-210-MPS, and the checkered pattern is not noticeable. So all in all these have nothing to do with MD/XD and is just a visual result of the methods used to make the surface Hydrophobic. The only way to tell which side is which is this one:
