shortDescription: LOCTITE ABLESTIK 2053S is a polymer filled, hybrid non conductive die attach adhesive with low warpage, high adhesion, low stress and low moisture uptake, designed for use in array packaging. It exhibits great optical performance, complimented by high transmittance, high Optical density and HRI and good adhesion to various interfaces such as EMC, engineering plastic, glass and metals. It is a low modulus, chip bonding, die attach paste for larger die size that works, among others, for chip bonding on FR4 substrates. It is considered a low modulus epoxy alternative to QMI536NB with less tendency to bleed than Bismaleimide containing, QMI materials. The modulus is ~3 times lower so this can be critical for wire bonding small die sizes. LOCTITE ABLESTIK 2053S offers relatively high thermal conductivity with stable optical performance, good temporary bonding and minimal shift and tilt post reliability. It has been successfully used for the ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) attach of automotive optical sensors, as a receiver Die attach for 3d sensing modules.

As part of Henkel&rsquo;s commitment to becoming 100% PFAS-free by 2027, 2053S will be phased out.

- Is 2053SNP a replacement or an alternative? Henkel has confirmed that 2053SNP should be considered the direct replacement for 2053S. It has been formulated to match the performance of the existing product, with the only change being the removal of the PFAS-containing anti-bleed agent. No significant property differences are expected (TDS comparison confirms this).

- Will this affect other Henkel PFAS-containing materials? Yes. This transition is part of a broader portfolio-wide PFAS removal initiative. Any products containing PFAS are being reviewed and will follow a similar process.

- Will a PCN / End-of-Life notice be issued? Yes. Henkel will issue the official EOL notification in January 2026, with a Last Time Buy window during December 2026. Given the 12-month shelf life, qualification of 2053SNP should be completed by the end of 2027.
