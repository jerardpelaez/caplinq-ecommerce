  - Stable at high temperatures
shortDescription: LOCTITE ABLESTIK QMI529HT die attach paste was developed as a soft-solder replacement or for high UPH performance applications. Maximum productivity is realized through in-line cure, either on the diebonder using a post diebond heater or on the wirebonder preheater. Taking the relatively high viscosity and thixotropy of QMI 529HT into account, we believe that it’s worth testing this world wide established and proven die attach paste using stencil printing in parallel. QMI 529HT should have the potential to print small dots like ~100um diameter. LOCTITE ABLESTIK QMI529HT is a hydrophobic BMI/acrylate product that exhibits excellent electrical and thermal conductivity and is stable at high temperatures. It offers high resistance to delamination and excellent adhesive strength with a void free bondline. LOCTITE ABLESTIK QMI529HT works great on Copper, Silver plated copper, Preplated NiPdAu leadframe and Alloy 42, has high resistance to heat and humidity and good resistance to "popcorning" after exposure to reflow temperatures. Snap Cure 60 seconds @ 185°C Oven Cure 30 minutes @ 185°C or 30 minutes @ 200 to 220°C (for higher adhesion)

QMI529HT used to be available in Techcon syringes with sticking rubber pistons. These became slowly obsolete and phased out for the superior EFD syringes. If you already have a Techcon setup you will need to buy an EFD adapter for ~50 EUR (we don't sell those) and you can immediately start using EFDs.
