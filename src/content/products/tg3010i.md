shortDescription: Honeywell TG3010I Thermal Silicone Grease is the optimized version of TG3000I. Specifically formulated for high-power density applications, TG3010I delivers superior thermal management by minimizing interfacial thermal resistance. It features a thermal conductivity (TC) of 3.0 W/mK and an exceptionally low thermal impedance (TI) of 0.003 °C·cm²/W. A key differentiator is its ability to consistently achieve a remarkably thin bond line thickness of 10 microns at 35 psi and 50°C, facilitated by its fine 7um maximum particle size. This, combined with its excellent electrical insulation properties, makes it an exceptional product in our thermal grease catalogue. Furthermore, TG3010I's low viscosity and excellent thixotropic characteristics ensure suitability for various large-scale production methods, including dispensing, screen printing, and stencil printing, with minimal risk of oil separation. Designed to maintain its exceptional performance through rigorous reliability testing, TG3010I offers a broad operating temperature range from -40°C to 150°C, ensuring robust thermal performance and ease of use across a wide array of critical applications. Applications High power density applications such as power converters and high power electronics (CPUs and GPUs). LED assemblies IGBT & power units FCBGA

### Will I have any issues with fretting(friction) with Greases?


After conducting a thermally degrading test you might realise that these greases are highly filled (~93.5% residual mass). Can this be a cause for concern when it comes to fretting and friction? The short answer is no.


The long answer is that Zinc oxide and aluminum oxide are common fillers in greases and other TIMs. These materials are also used in our phase change TIMs and there has rarely been any issues with fretting (friction) during dispensing or other applications. Fretting is only a concern with boron nitride as filler. Friction related impact is also minimal on low viscosity greases. So you are safe.
