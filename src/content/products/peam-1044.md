shortDescription: PEAM-1044 is a polyester acrylate/methacrylate that exhibits excellent adhesion, low warpage, and hydrophobicity. The oligomer has very high thermal stability and low volatility. It can be used as a base resin in a formulation or an additive. It is dark amber-colored, something that needs to be considered for light cure application. PEAM-1044 is recommended for use as a base resin. It has excellent adhesion with low stress due to its high Tg DCPD units. The oligomer has good solubility in both aliphatic and aromatic resins. Exceptionally low warpage can be achieved with the addition of polybutadiene type resins. Compared to what most people use (epoxies) the PEAM-1044 is composed of large, low functionality, oligomers instead of small, highly cross-linked monomers. That's why it is common to use PEAM 645 which is more akin to epoxies or a combination of both.
