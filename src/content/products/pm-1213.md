Processing Instructions





Mix Parts A and B in a 100:100 weight ratio. Ensure that the mixture is uniform and free from streaks or unevenness.




Defoam the mixture under vacuum.




Typical curing conditions: First cure at 95 °C for 60 min, followed by post-cure at 150 °C for 4 hours.


- Recommended ramp up temperature is 5°C/minute from ambient




The curing conditions provided are recommended guidelines based on typical laboratory results. Actual curing parameters should be defined and validated by the user to ensure compatibility with specific materials, part geometries, and end-use requirements. It is the user’s responsibility to optimize and confirm curing conditions that meet their performance and quality standards.


Precautions





Addition-cure materials may be susceptible to inhibition by certain substances, including organotin and other organometallic compounds, silicone rubber with organotin catalyst, sulfur-containing materials such as polysulfones, amines, urethanes, amine-containing materials, unsaturated hydrocarbon plasticizers, and some solder flux residues. Always exercise caution and conduct thorough compatibility testing when encountering materials or chemicals of concern in your specific application to prevent potential curing issues.




Avoid skin and eye contact. In case of contact, rinse thoroughly with soap (for skin) or clean water (for eyes), and seek medical attention if needed.




Maintain a clean and ventilated workplace, using extraction trunks when necessary.




Wear appropriate protective equipment and minimize direct contact with the human body. Refer to the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) before use.







The technical information presented in this document is provided for reference only and does not constitute a guarantee of specific properties or performance. Actual results may vary depending on individual conditions and application methods. Users are strongly advised to perform their own testing and validation to determine suitability for their intended use and compliance with relevant regulations.




Cleaning


Uncured silicone can be easily removed using common hydrocarbon solvents, such as acetone or xylene. Polar solvents, including water and alcohols, are not recommended for this application.




Storage and Handling


Store in a ventilated, dry, and clean environment below 25 °C. Do not allow moisture to come into contact with these materials. Containers should always remain tightly sealed. For partially filled containers, it is recommended to purge them with dry air or inert gases like nitrogen to maintain product integrity. At proper storage conditions, Part A and B have a shelf life of 6 months.
