### Application

#### Usage Instructions

- 5252M may be used at ambient temperature with ultrasonics, stencil spray equipment, immersion agitation, or manual application.

- When the residue has completely dissolved and is no longer visible, rinse off the residual solution with more solvent.

- The goal is not only to dissolve the residue but also to remove it after dissolution.

#### Drying and Rinsing

- 5252M dries fast and usually does not require a water rinse.

- After cleaning, stencils or electronic assemblies should be dried by evaporation or solvent displacement with forced air.

- For additional cleanliness, a secondary 5252M rinse may be used.

#### Maintenance

- The bath life of the cleaner solvent depends on cleanliness requirements.

- Replace the solvent at regular intervals to avoid contamination.
