ABP 2100A is containing a PFAS anti-bleed agent and will be discontinued as Henkel moves towards greener materials. The direct PFAS-free replacement is ABP 2100ANP, with only minor changes. Notification is planned for January 2026, with the last-time-buy in December 2026.

Loctite Ablestik 2100A is a product that is an almost direct alternative to Loctite Ablestik 2000B.

Loctite Ablestik 2000B is also a conductive die attach for laminates that it is mainly used in Asian regions. For EMEA we have successfully used 2100A as a drop in for use in BGA laminate applications with great success rates.

Notice how the Onset of cure (minimum cure temperature) is about 70&deg;C. Even though we suggest curing at 175&deg;C, as with all products you can adjust the cure schedule (with a lot of trial, error and personal work) according to your final application properties.

The volume resistivity may be reduced when curing below 175&deg;C (compared to the TDS value), but we expect that some conductivity will be developed.
