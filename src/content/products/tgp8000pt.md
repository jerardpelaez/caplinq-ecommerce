shortDescription: "Honeywell TGP 8000PT Thermally Conductive Putty Pads provide high thermal performance and excellent thermal reliability (8 W/mK). The material’s putty-like design enables excellent gap-filling capability for applications with large dimensional variances within surfaces. Special surface reinforcement enables easier handling for operators during high volume assembly. Pads thicker than 0.5mm come contained and reinforced within single sided fiber glass and dual liners. Honeywell TGP 8000PT is naturally tacky and requires no additional adhesive to mate to heat source and heat sink. This product can be used for unbalanced mounting pressure applications while also improving dripping and pump out, compared to thermal grease. It is available in thicknesses ranging from 1.0mm to 5.0mm. With 10~70% compression, the final BLT could reach a minimum of 0.5mm.

## Thermal putty pad VS. thermal gap pad



Thermal putty pads and thermal gap pad are similar products. For example, TGP8000 and TGP8000PT both have high thermal conductivity as 8 W/m.K and need at least 10% compression while applying. The main difference is that thermal putty pads are ultra-soft and could be compressed up to 90%. It almost has no tensile strength and no elasticity, thus will not recover and bounce back. Due to the low stress and high compressibility, thermal putty pads are more suitable for applications with large dimensional variances, comparing with traditional thermal gap pad.





## Thermal putty pad VS. thermal hybrid gel



Both thermal putty pad and thermal hybrid gel belongs to gap filler type TIM, which are applicable for large bone line thickness application (>0.5mm). Thermal gel products are designed for automation process such as dispensing. Compared with hybrid gels, putty pads are suitable for large area assembly. It is easy to apply thermal putty pads manually and there is no needs for dispensing equipment.
