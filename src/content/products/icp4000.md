subcategory: electrically-conductive-adhesives
sellingPoints:
  - High temperature performance
  - Excellent electrical conductivity
  - Flexible and low stress
shortDescription: LOCTITE ABLESTIK ICP 4000 is a silicone based, silver filled, flexible, electrically conductive adhesive. It is specially designed for applications where both high flexibility and excellent conductivity are required. This material is recommended for use in mounting small components to a variety of interconnect substrates. It exhibits strong adhesion under high vibration testing. LOCTITE ABLESTIK ICP 4000 is engineered to maintain its flexibility and conductivity at elevated temperatures, up to 200ºC. It can be dispensed with commonly used time-pressure and auger valve technology and can be applied by pin-transfer. It can also be stencil printed but dispensing is the recommended method. To add to that it has excellent electrical performance, works great for noble component attach and has a high electrical current carrying capability. Compared to ICP 40001 it has better electrical performance but lower adhesion. Cure Schedule 1 hour @ 130°C or 35 minutes @ 140°C

DMA Analysis


CTE is always the one above Tg as the Tg is always so low in these products that a decent measurement below that temperature is almost impossible with our machines.
