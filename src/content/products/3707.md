shortDescription: "LOCTITE ECCOBOND 3707 UV curable edgebond is designed for bonding various types of electronic components on a PCB. It mainly plays a structural role in the packaging process. LOCTITE ECCOBOND 3707 is a white, single component epoxy that is typically used for UV Curable CSP (Chip Scale Packages) and as a BGA (Ball Grid Array) Cornerbond. UV Cure: >3,000mJ or >30 seconds @ 100 mW/cm² Minimum intensity of 100 mW/cm² is recommended for the UV lamp Oven Cure: 2 minutes @ 130°C"

UV/Light Cure Strengths



- One component

- No solvents

- Very fast room temperature cure

- Cure on demand-facilitates parts alignment

- Less equipment space and energy

- Fast through put-low WIP






UV/Light Cure Limitations



- Sensitive to light-requires special space lighting

- Oxygen inhibits cure

- Line of sight cure- shadowed areas require secondary cure

- High CTE- fillers used to lower CTE block UV/light
