shortDescription: "LINQCELL SFP1000 is a 1mm Stainless Steel Fiber Felt, meticulously crafted to meet the highest quality standards. This non-woven media is constructed from premium 304, 304L, 316, 316L, 310s stainless steel through a process that randomly lays short stainless steel fibers, followed by sintering and bonding, resulting in an exceptionally durable and efficient material. SFPXXX Series comes in thicknesses ranging from 0.25mm to 1.2mm. LINQCELL SFP1000 is ideally suited for applications that demand top-tier performance under extreme conditions, such as high pressure, elevated temperatures, and corrosive environments. The fleece of stainless steel fibers can consist of multiple layers, which can be compressed to the desired thickness and then sintered to fuse the individual fibers. The outcome is a highly porous, robust material with remarkable resistance to corrosion, high temperatures, and fractures. Additionally, it offers outstanding permeability, a micron range of 3-100μm and a longer lifespan compared to conventional filtration media. Key Features: Unlike woven wire mesh, SFP1000 exhibits fine and consistent pore sizes. Easy to work with and mold into various shapes, offering flexibility in application. Excellent for filtration of hot materials and electrical applications due to low electrical heat resistance. Stable Pore Opening: The pore opening remains stable and resists compromise. SFP1000 offers a high dirt holding capacity, ensuring extended service life."
