shortDescription: LINQBOND T242 is medium strength, general purpose, removable threadlocker for fasteners bettween 1/4" and 3/4" (6 to 20 mm) diameters. It has controlled lubricity for accurate clamp loads and parts can easily be separable using hand-held tools. LINQBOND T242 is a medium viscosity, medium strength threadlocking adhesives for ferrous and non-ferrous threaded fasteners. Cured performance is consistent with other industrial fastener finishes such as black oxide and zinc plated steel. LINQBOND T242 has good solvent resistance against most industrial solvents and can be used on most metal surfaces including oily steel, stainless steel, aluminum, and zinc-plated metals. It is also formulated to provide a consistent torque-tension relationship across the recommended torque range for grade 5 fasteners.

Directions for Use



- Apply adhesive to the male thread. The area does not need to be fully covered with the adhesive to achieve good locking torque.

- Assemble the male and female threads together. Tighten to the desired torque within 5 minutes of assembly.




Curing Information



- Fixture Time: 15-20 mins on zinc, steel, and black oxide finishes

- Full strength: 24 hours
