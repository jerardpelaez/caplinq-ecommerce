## Competitive Analysis TMC-8060



For LED applications, it is expected to keep properties of optical encapsulants as low decay as possible. This mainly depends on chemistry systems such as resin type. However, there will always be trade-offs between those properties aiming to achieve. TMC-8060 has the best capabilities of anti-blue/UV decay and anti-yellowing at high temperatures among OPTOLINQ TMC series products for optoelectronics encapsulation. It has comparable high temperature stability with XX-1000 and XX-814. If you prefer a product with better moisture resistance aiming at passing high MSL tests, TMC-8040 is a better option and equivalent to XX-600H.










## TMC-8060 Superior Low Decay Against Heat And UV






## Advanced Versions Aimed At Automotive Applications



For automotive applications, optoelectronics need to pass harsh thermal cycling tests (TCT). To meet higher TCT test requirements. , the CTE mismatch among various packaging materials induces high thermal-mechanical stresses resulting in package expansion and shrinkage by high and low temperatures. It will cause a failure like warpage, delamination, crack, etc. This could be improved by controlling the thermal stress and improving adhesion strength between epoxy compound and substrate.


TMC-8060-IMP product with flexible segment achieved lower modulus comparing with TMC-8060 original version, could meet higher thermal cycling test requirements.




TMC-9000T with transparent filler technology achieves low CTE and low water absorption, comparing with TC-8060. It also remains the superior anti-blue decay properties of TMC-8060. For harsh TCT requirements and high MSL requirements, TMC-9000T is recommended.
