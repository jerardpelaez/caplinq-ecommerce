name: HumiSeal Thinner 903
slug: hs-t903
sku: HS-T903
brand: CAPLINQ
category: thinners
subcategory: thinners
sellingPoints:
  - Slower evaporation rate
  - Smoother flow
  - Better leveling
shortDescription: Consider using HumiSeal Thinner 903 to adjust conformal coating viscosity when improved flow and leveling are required. Thinner 903 has moderate evaporation rate (~1) and higher boiling point, meaning the solvent stays wet longer, which helps coatings self-level for a smoother finish. Product Key Features Slower‑evaporating Ideal for smoother flow and better leveling on these conformal coatings Applications Ideal for use with 1B51NS & 1B51NSLU

### Directions for Use

Add HumiSeal&reg; Thinner to a compatible coating until the desired viscosity is obtained.

### Handling Precautions

HumiSeal&reg; Thinners are flammable and the following standard safety precautions should be observed:

- Use only in well ventilated areas.

- Protective gloves and goggles should be worn.

- In case of prolonged skin contact, wash with water.

- In case of eye contact, flush with water and contact physician.

- Avoid prolonged breathing of vapors.
