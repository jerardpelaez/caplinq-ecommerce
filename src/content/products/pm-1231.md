### Processing Instructions



- Before potting, make sure the surface is clean. Remove any oil or dust.

- Mix component A and B according to specified ratio. Stir thoroughly to ensure uniformity while preventing air to be introduced into the mixture. Automatic mixing and filling machine can be used. Scrape the sides of the container to ensure even mixing until the color is consistent throughout.

- Use the mixture within 30 minutes.

- Allow the potted workpiece cure at room temperature until the surface is dry. Full curing typically occurs within 48 hours. The curing process is influenced by temperature variations; generally, higher temperatures result in faster curing, while lower temperatures lead to slower curing.




### Precautions for Use



- Before use, thoroughly mix Part A. Stratification may occur during long-term storage due to its high specific gravity. Mixing ensures consistent product performance. Do this in a well-ventilated area.

- Use all of the mixed Part A and B at once. Seal and store any components for future use.

- Typically, keep the potting thickness within 30mm. For deeper potting, contact the manufacturer for guidance.




Please note that the provided information is based on available data and typical conditions. For specific applications and detailed test results, refer to the actual test data and conduct appropriate certifications.


### Storage and Handling


The product can withstand long-term exposure to fresh water, sewage, waste water, calcium carbonate aqueous solution, detergent, low-acid, and corrosive water solutions. It has short-term resistance to mineral oil, vegetable oil, fat, and fuel. However, it is not resistant to organic solvents, paint thinners, high-concentration acids, or alkalis.


Store in a ventilated, dry, and clean environment at 10–30 °C. Keep away from fire and heat sources. It is strictly forbidden to store in outdoor environments. At proper storage conditions, Part A and Part B has a shelf life of 6 months. Shelf life can be extended by using cold storage.
