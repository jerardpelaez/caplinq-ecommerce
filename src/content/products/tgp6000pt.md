shortDescription: Honeywell TGP 6000PT Thermally Conductive Putty Pads provide high thermal performance and excellent thermal reliability. The material’s putty-like design enables excellent gap-filling capability for applications with large dimensional variances. Special surface reinforcement enables easier handling for operators during high volume assembly. It comes contained and reinforced within single sided fiber glass and dual liners. Honeywell TGP 6000PT is naturally tacky and requires no additional adhesive to mate to heat source and heat sink. This product can replace thermal grease and improve dripping and pump out. It is available in thicknesses ranging from 1.0mm to 5.0mm. Need a thickness below 1mm? Then we recommend our standard Thermal gap pads.
