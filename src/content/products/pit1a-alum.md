shortDescription: LINQTAPE PIT1A-ALUM is a high performance, high-temperature resistant aluminized polyimide film, formed by sputtering aluminum onto polyimide using an aluminum vacuum deposition method. This combination of materials allows that one side is an insulation side and the other is conductive. In addition to that we add an Acrylic adhesive either by coating it or laminating it on either side of the film (so Polyimide or Aluminum facing). The laminated version comes with a paper liner while the coated version comes without a liner. LINQTAPE PIT1A-ALUM combines Polyimide and sputtered aluminum to give a very heat resistant, mechanically and chemically stable, radiation-resistant, and self-extinguishing product that has very high thermal conductivity and EMI shielding. LINQTAPE PIT1A-ALUM is a used in a number of applications, including as a first surface mirror for multilayer insulation (MLI) blankets, EMI shielding, electromagnetic shielding tape and flexible etching wire. Please note that the Acrylic adhesive will (naturally) degrade in a much lower temperature than the Polyimide (±150°C). This layer is added to aid the application of the Film but you shouldn't expect it to last at the same temperatures without any degradation.
