shortDescription: HT3500 silicone based one-part Gap Filler - thermal gel provides a thermal conductivity of 3.5 W/mK along with high conformability and high compressibility. It is formulated to deliver high dispense rates for improved productivity, long-term reliability performance and easy reworkability. HT3500 is designed to minimize thermal resistance at interfaces, maintain excellent performance through reliability testing, and provide scalable application at a competitive cost. The minimum bondline thickness that it can reach is 0.1mm with a Thermal Impedance of 0.4. Additionally it performs great in oil,crack and slump testing and it exhibits no pump out and cracking risk. This is the most popular, commercial version of the material but we also provide the LV (low volatile) version for specific applications such as optical that might require i.e less clouding. HT3500 has a high flow rate, above 15 g/min, high breakdown strength (above 5 kV/mm) and very low out gassing (below 0.5%)
