shortDescription: "LINQALLOY Sn10Pb90 is a high lead containing solder sphere alloy. Even though the world is moving away from Lead for consumer electronics, there are still applications that cannot be supported with Lead Free alternatives due to their high operating temperatures. For those limited cases, we offer the Sn10Pb90 solder spheres that have an extremely high melting temperature. Industries like automotive and manufacturing need to rely on these solutions until a fully qualified and functional alternative is developed. Features: Melting Temperature range 301&deg;C Ideal for High operating temperature applications 10&deg;C transition range Each jar has a clear label on the lid specifying the solder ball diameter as well as a label on the front identifying the alloy type, the quantity of spheres in the jar, the date of manufacture, and the product lot (or batch) number. This batch number is tied to a certificate of conformance that is also provided with the solder spheres and ensures the Sn10Pb90 solder spheres meet the following quality criteria: Tin (Sn): 10% Lead(Pb): 90% Melting Temperature: 268 - 301&deg;C Sphericity: Within 1.5% Diameter Tolerance 0.1mm - 0.25mm (100&micro;m - 250&micro;m) : &plusmn; 0.0050mm (&plusmn; 5&micro;m) 0.3mm - 0.45mm (300&micro;m - 450&micro;m) : &plusmn; 0.010mm (&plusmn; 10&micro;m) 0.5mm - 0.89mm (500&micro;m - 890&micro;m) : &plusmn; 0.020mm ( &plusmn; 20&micro;m)"

### What do I get when I buy Sn10Pb90 Eutectic Solder Spheres from CAPLINQ?

The advantage of ordering solder spheres online at CAPLINQ.com is that you can be sure of the quality. The solder spheres you receive are originally manufactured solder spheres packed into jars with inert gas (nitrogen). We do not repack the solder balls we receive, so the jars you will receive have never been opened, thus ensuring the quality of the product. The lid of the jar is also always sealed with a shrink-wrapped plastic wrap ensuring that the solder spheres do not oxidate in the jar.
