### OPTOLINQ OLS-1000 Series | Visible Light Blocking Capabilities


OLS-1000LV and OLS-1000HV are developed with compatibility to various dyes with different onset transmittance as shown.






































Processing Instructions:



- Pre-heat Part A at 45~60°C for a maximum of 24 hours.

- Mix components A and B and stir uniformly.

- Defoam the mixture for 5 minutes.

- Curing conditions (Determine according to the specific needs of the product, following conditions are for reference only.) Cure at 130 - 145°C/1 - 1.5hrs




Precautions:



- For optimal results, use the mixture within 6-8 hours after combining components A and B. Delaying application may lead to an undesirable increase in viscosity.

- Bake the molded package as soon as possible to prevent degradation by moisture.

- Pre-heating component A at 45~60°C can reduce viscosity, but excessively high temperatures will shorten the its pot life.

- Store the curing agent (component B) in sealed jars to prevent moisture absorption and sedimentation.

- Avoid skin and eye contact. In case of contact, rinse thoroughly with soap (for skin) or clean water (for eyes), and seek medical attention if needed.

- Maintain a clean and ventilated workplace, using extraction trunks when necessary.

- Wear appropriate protective equipment and minimize direct contact with the human body. Refer to the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) before use.




Please note that the provided information is based on available data and typical conditions. For specific applications and detailed test results, refer to the actual test data and conduct appropriate certifications.


Storage and Handling


Store in a ventilated, dry, and clean environment below 25°C. Keep away from fire and heat sources. It is strictly forbidden to store in outdoor environments. At proper storage conditions, Part A has a shelf life of 6 months and Part B a shelf life of 3 months. Shelf life can be extended by using cold storage.
