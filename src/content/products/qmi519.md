shortDescription: LOCTITE ABLESTIK QMI519 silver filled conductive adhesive is a proprietary Hybrid BMI/Acrylate resin, recommended for use in bonding integrated circuits and components to metal leadframes. It is is designed to achieve UPHs several orders of magnitude higher than conventional oven cured adhesives. After 1500 hours of testing it is, by far, the strongest die attach paste (almost double of 8302 which comes at the 2nd place). The initial adhesion is in "mid-range" but it increases heavily during aging. LOCTITE ABLESTIK QMI519 maximum productivity is realized through in-line cure, either on the die bonder using a post diebond heater or on the wirebonder preheater. Studies have also shown improved coplanarity in parts cured on the die bonder. This product and its use may be covered by patent 5,717,034 and by one or more pending patent applications. LOCTITE ABLESTIK QMI519 is an electrically and thermally conductive, hydrophobic product that achieves void free bondlines and stability at high temperatures. It is typically used for SOIC, SOP, QFP and QFN type packages and on a wide variety of metals and ceramic surfaces, Copper, Silver, Palladium and Alloy 42. It is a great product of choice for PPF leadframes. SkipCure Process ≥10 seconds @ 200°C Typical Cure 15minutes @ 185°C 15minutes @ 200 to 220°C
