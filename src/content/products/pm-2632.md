shortDescription: LINQBOND PM-2632 is a black, two-part flame-retardant potting epoxy resin. With its low viscosity after mixing, it offers a long service life and easy application process. PM-2632 can be cured at low temperature, and once cured, it exhibits excellent electrical, thermal dissipation, and mechanical properties. LINQBOND PM-2632 is an ideal potting material for small electronic components, such as capacitors, and epoxy resin for edge casting applications. Its operating temperature is -20 up to 100°C.

### Precautions for Use



- Storing Part A for an extended duration may cause filler precipitation. Stir thoroughly before use to achieve uniform filler distribution.

- During cold seasons, preheat Part A at 30–50 °C for best results.

- The usable time of Parts A and B after mixing is affected by temperature and mixing volume. The higher the temperature and the larger the mixing volume, the shorter the usable time. Therefore, the mixing temperature and mixing volume should be determined according to the on-site operation.

- Please wear relevant protective equipment before use, minimizing direct contact with the skin. Pay careful attention to the details and review the Material Safety Data Sheet (SDS) before initiating use.




### Storage and Handling


Store in a ventilated, dry, and clean environment at room temperature. Keep away from fire and heat sources. At proper storage conditions, Part A and Part B both have a shelf life of 183 days. Shelf life can be extended by using cold storage.
