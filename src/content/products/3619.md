shortDescription: "LOCTITE 3619 is designed for bonding of surface mounted devices to printed circuit boards prior to wave soldering. Particularly suited where low curing temperatures arerequired with heat sensitive components, and in applications where short curing times are required. LOCTITE 3619 is a red, high viscosity, epoxy paste with high wet strength. It claims 25,000 - 40,000 dots per hour dispensing speed and is typically used for mountin SMD components onto a PCB. Cure schedule 30 minutes @ 100°C Note: Sufficient time must be added to allow the bond location to reach the desired cure temperature. Curing profiles should be developed for each device. Bond strength achieved in practice will vary considerably depending on the SMD component type, adhesive dot size and the type, grade and degree of cure of the solder mask/resist."
