shortDescription: "TG1500I Thermal Silicone Grease offers a thermal conductivity of 1.5 W/mK and a controlled bond line thickness of 30 micron @35psi, 50oC. Its viscosity and excellent thixotropy make it fit for large–scale production with dispensing, screen printing and stencil printing. It is an excellent, option for thermally demanding applications that can support a >30um BLT. TG1500I is used for applications with high power density requirements. It provides superior thermal performance with ease of use across a multitude of applications. It is a stable homogeneous mixture under room temperature with an operating temperature range of -40oC to 150oC. Please note that this thermal grease contains solvent and requires a drying step. Product Key Features: Low thermal resistance (0.021°C-in²/W at 50 psi) — effectively address overheating and reliability issues Maintains high reliability and performance across demanding environments and applications Suitable for use in pneumatic dispensing and screen printing systems, supporting automated and high-volume manufacturing Applications Heat dissipation from heat-generating components (like CPUs and GPUs) to cooling solutions (like heat sinks)."
