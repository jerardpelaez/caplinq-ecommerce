shortDescription: "LINQALLOY Ag96 Au Flash, Pd coated Silver wire is a winded，smooth surfaced, unpolluted bonding wire, ideal for LED and IC semiconductor applications. It is available in thicknesses ranging from 18 to 25 microns and is fully compliant with the RoHS requirements of specific hazardous substance control. LINQALLOY Ag96 is a low purity Silver bonding wire that is softer than traditional Copper wires and much cheaper than Gold wires while maintaining the wire drawing ability and reliability due to the thin Gold layer addition. Meanwhile the Palladium coating enhances the storage reliability while also preventing Ag dissolution. Low purity Silver alloys have higher resistivity, so for applications requiring higher speeds you might want to look at alternatives such as Linqalloy Ag99 Storage conditions: Gold flash Palladium coated Silver wires can be stored for 12 months in a vacuum sealed bag and need to be used in 48hours after exposure to ambient environment. In a Nitrogen protected environment they have a work life of 7 days. The vacuum sealed product needs to be stored in a stable and clean environment. The optimum storage temperature is ±25℃ with a relative humidity ranging from 30% to 70%. Once unsealed, put the product in a Nitrogen protected environment (up to 7 days). Otherwise, the recommended service life is 48 hours for ambient exposure . It is recommended to use hydrogen-nitrogen mixed gas with a hydrogen content of 5.0% for protection while bonding"
