shortDescription: Hysol GR180R is a white, reflective epoxy molding compound used for optical applications. This fused silica filled (76 - 86%) product has been specifically designed to improve light reflectance and workability for optocouplers also knows as photo-couplers, optical isolators, or opto-isolators. Hysol GR180R cures with heat and has a filler cut size of 75um that is ideal for transfer processes. It has been formulated to provide the best possible moldability and for a wide range of molding process parameters.
