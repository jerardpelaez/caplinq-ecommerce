shortDescription: "Kester 5744 Solder Saver is a chloride-free, inorganic white powder that removes dross, which is solder oxide, from still solder pots and wave soldering machines. 5744 does not decompose into a sticky residue that are more challenging to remove than the actual dross. It is also formulated to be low-fuming and stable at soldering temepratures and has been shown to be effective up to 380℃ (720℉), making it ideal for both lead and lead-free solder baths. Kester 5744 Solder Saver is non-flammable and remains a white solid appearance while worrking to remove dross. It is easily removed from solder pots after use. Product Key Features Effectively removes dross (the oxide of solder) from the surface of molten solder baths. Low-fuming and remains stable at soldering temperatures. Can be easily skimmed off the pot after use. Applications Still solder pots & wave soldering machines. Note: For effective use, it must be applied to a still solder pot surface (all wave pumping and agitation turned off), and the powder is sprinkled on the surface and slowly mixed with the dross before being skimmed off."

### Application

- 5744 must be used on a still solder pot surface. All solder wave pumping and agitation action must be turned off. The pot temperature should be controlled to 232 to 260 &deg;C (450 to 500 &deg;F).

- Cover the solder surface with 5744 by sprinkling the powder on the pot in a thin covering layer, no greater than 6.4 mm (0.25 in) thick.

- Slowly mix the salt with the surface of the solder with a metallic solder ladle or a metal spatula. Allow the salt 10 seconds after mixing to convert the dross back to solder.

- Move any dross on the pot into the salt covered surface to covert the dross to metal.

- When done, remove the dross recovery salt and other dirt residues with a metallic solder ladle or a metal spatula.

- All of the 5744 should be removed from the solder surface. 5744 is intended to be used as received.
