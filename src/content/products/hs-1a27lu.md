- Industrial automation (e.g., motor drives, PLCs)

- Consumer electronics (e.g., smartphones, gaming devices)






### Why choose HumiSeal® 1A27LU over other conformal coatings?




HumiSeal® 1A27LU is easy to use and provides excellent protection. It provides excellent electrical insulation, fluoresces under UV for easy inspection, and is easily repairable with HumiSeal® Stripper 1063. It is also compliant with MIL-I-46058C and RoHS 2002/95/EC, making it a trusted choice for demanding applications. You can learn how to select a conformal coating in our latest blog.






### What is the shelf life of HumiSeal® 1A27LU?


HumiSeal® 1A27LU has a shelf life of 24 months from the date of manufacture when stored at room temperature (0 to 35°C) in tightly closed containers. Prior to use, allow the product to equilibrate for 24 hours at 18 to 32°C to ensure optimal performance.




### How should I clean tools after applying HumiSeal® 1A27LU?


Tools and equipment used for applying HumiSeal® 1A27LU (e.g., spray guns, brushes, or dipping tanks) can be cleaned using HumiSeal® Thinner 521 for spraying. For removing the coating from PCBs during rework, use HumiSeal® Stripper 1063. Always use a lint-free cloth and ensure proper ventilation during cleaning.






### What happens to HumiSeal® 1A27LU after its shelf life?


Past its 24-month shelf life, HumiSeal® 1A27LU may experience changes in viscosity, which could affect application consistency and coating uniformity. Using expired product may lead to suboptimal performance, and the manufacturer will not be liable for quality or performance issues if expired material is used.




### Why do curing times vary for HumiSeal® 1A27LU?


HumiSeal® 1A27LU is a fast air drying coating. Drying times vary depending on temperature, humidity, and film thickness. Typically, the coating will be tack-free in approximately 15 minutes, dry to handle in one hour, and fully cured in 24 hours.






### What is the recommended thickness for HumiSeal® 1A27LU?


The recommended coating thickness for HumiSeal® 1A27LU is 25 to 75 microns. This range ensures optimal protection without compromising flexibility or electrical performance. The thickness can be adjusted by controlling viscosity with HumiSeal® Thinner 521 during application.




### What are the differences between application methods for HumiSeal® 1A27LU?


HumiSeal® 1A27LU can be applied via spraying, dipping, or brushing. Spraying and dipping are ideal for large-scale production, while brushing is suited for small repairs. Each method requires adjusting viscosity with Thinner 521 for a uniform coating.






### What is the maximum operating temperature for HumiSeal® 1A27LU?


HumiSeal® 1A27LU can withstand thermal shock from –65°C to +125°C. It is not recommended for continuous operation above 130°C, as prolonged exposure to higher temperatures may degrade its protective properties.




### What safety precautions should I take when using HumiSeal® 1A27LU?


The solvents in HumiSeal® 1A27LU are flammable, so avoid open flames or sparks during application. Use in a well-ventilated area to prevent inhalation of vapors or spray mist, and avoid skin and eye contact. Always consult the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) prior to use for detailed safety guidelines.






### How can I ensure proper application of HumiSeal® 1A27LU?


HumiSeal® 1A27LU fluoresces under UV light, allowing for easy inspection of coating coverage. After application, use a UV light source to check for uniform coating and ensure there are no missed areas, which is critical for high-reliability electronics manufacturing.
