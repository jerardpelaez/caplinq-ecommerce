shortDescription: LOCTITE® ABLESTIK QMI536 is a Fluoropolymer filled non-conductive adhesive for attachment of integrated circuits and components to advanced substrates, including PBGAs, CSPs, array packages, and stacked die. This material is hydrophobic and stable at high temperatures. These features produce a void-free bond line with excellent interfacial adhesive strength to a wide variety of organic and metal surfaces, including solder mask, BT, FR, polyimide, and Au. The adhesive also has excellent dielectric properties. LOCTITE ABLESTIK QMI536 can be cured in a conventional oven, on a snap cure oven, or utilize SkipCure processing on a die bonder or wire bonder. The material is formulated to produce cure onset below 100°C. This can reduce or eliminate the need to pre-dry organic substrates prior to the die attach process. LOCTITE ABLESTIK QMI536 has excellent rheology and flows easily under shear stresses such as those present during die bonding. Therefore, bondforces used with other adhesives which produce a certain bondline thickness, may result in thinner bondlines with LOCTITE ABLESTIK QMI536. Optimization of die bonding parameters is strongly recommended, to consistently meet target bondline thickness. Cure Schedule ≥10 @ 150°C (SkipCure) 15 minutes @ 150 °C (Convection Box Oven)
