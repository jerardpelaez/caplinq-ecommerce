shortDescription: Hysol GR2822 is a silica filled (88%), black, epoxy molding compound. Despite what the name implies, it is not a newer version of 2820 but an improved version of our gold GR2811. Hysol GR2811 showed poor moisture resistance (crack after MSL3) and discolouration issues under harsh circumstances. GR 2822 was developed to solve those issues and while black, be used for demanding applications. Hysol GR2822 heat curable EMC, meets JEDEC MSL 3 requirements and is a green product designed for tandalum conductive polymer capacitors. It exhibits very low stress, low moisture absorption and good electrical performance.
