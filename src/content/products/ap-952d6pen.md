shortDescription: KESTER 952-D6 Flux-Pen&reg; is a no-clean, non-corrosive, halide-free Flux-Pen&reg; that is specifically designed for lead-free rework of conventional and surface mount circuit board assemblies. Essentially no residue remains after soldering. 952-D6 was developed with a modified surface tension to aid in soldering boards that have surface mount and high component densities. This comprehensive formulation possesses improved wetting characteristics and also exhibits superior corrosion inhibiting properties and provides a non-tacky residue. A major advantage of this flux is the reduced odor associated with the soldering process. 952-D6 incorporates a small amount of rosin for higher reliability. Product Key Features No-clean formula Halide-free & non-corrosive Enhances solder flow on boards with high component density. Improved wetting characteristics Non-tacky residue & rosin-enhanced Applications Lead-free rework of conventional and surface mount circuit board assemblies
