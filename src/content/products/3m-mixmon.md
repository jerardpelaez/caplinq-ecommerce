## Verify Adhesive Mix Quality Before Application

Improve process reliability without changing your dispensing setup.

The 3M&trade; Adhesive Mix Monitor improves two-part adhesive dispensing by providing real-time visibility into adhesive mix quality at the point of dispense. This enables earlier detection of mix ratio and cure issues, helping reduce scrap, rework, and bond failures.

#### Reduce adhesive waste caused by unnecessary purging

In two-part adhesive dispensing, operators often purge conservatively because mix quality cannot be verified in real time, leading to excess material waste and downtime. In-process monitoring allows purging only when mix quality is out of specification, reducing adhesive waste and improving uptime.

#### Reduce rework by detecting mix quality issues before dispensing

Mix issues that are detected only after application typically require rework or scrapping of parts. Identifying adhesive mix quality problems before dispensing prevents defects from propagating downstream in the production process.

#### Improve dispensing consistency across operators and shifts

Two-part adhesive dispensing can feel like a &ldquo;black box&rdquo; to operators, leading to inconsistent practices and variable outcomes. Clear, in-process mix quality feedback improves process consistency across shifts, operators, and production lines.

#### Reduce bond failure risk from two-part adhesive mix errors

Improper mix ratio or incomplete cure in two-part adhesive dispensing can lead to latent bond failures that are only discovered after assembly or in the field. In-line, real-time monitoring of adhesive mix quality at the point of dispense helps identify mix errors before the adhesive reaches the part.

#### Enable part-level traceability of adhesive mix quality

Many manufacturing teams lack a way to link adhesive mix quality data to individual parts, making root-cause analysis difficult when failures occur. Time-stamped, in-process adhesive monitoring enables traceability of mix quality for quality control, audits, and failure investigations.

#### Support closed-loop control in automated adhesive dispensing systems

Without real-time process data, adhesive dispensing systems operate open-loop, making it difficult to correct process drift. Streaming adhesive mix quality data to a PLC enables closed-loop process control, alarms, and automated responses to out-of-spec conditions.

## 3M&trade; Adhesive Mix Monitor System Components

## How to Interpret the 3M&trade; Adhesive Mix Monitor Light Indicators

The indicator light provides immediate visual feedback on system readiness and adhesive mix quality during dispensing. Use the light status below to determine whether dispensing can proceed or corrective action is required.

#### Indicator Legend

- White (System Ready): After installation and setup, a steady white light indicates the system is ready to use.

- No White Light: If the indicator does not illuminate white after setup, an error occurred during setup and the system is not ready for operation.

- Green (In Dispensing Zone): During dispensing, a steady green light indicates the adhesive mix quality is within the acceptable dispensing zone and dispensing can proceed.

- Red (Blinking, Out of Dispensing Zone): At any point during dispensing, a blinking red light indicates the adhesive mix quality is outside the acceptable dispensing zone. Dispensing should be stopped.

#### Corrective Action

If the indicator blinks red during dispensing, take corrective action to adjust your dispensing process before resuming operation.

## How the 3M&trade; Adhesive Mix Monitor Interprets Sensor Response

The light indicator status is determined by comparing the real-time sensor response to predefined acceptance limits for adhesive mix quality.

#### How to Interpret Sensor Response

- During dispensing: Sensor response reflects the estimated volumetric mix ratio.

- After dispensing stops: Sensor response changes as the adhesive cures, reflecting cure kinetics.

#### Mix Ratio Representation (Base Part Fraction, BPF)

- Mix ratio is expressed as Base Part Fraction (BPF), the volumetric fraction of Part B in the total mixture.

- Example: 2:1 (B:A) corresponds to a BPF of 0.67.

The BPF for any mix ratio can be calculated using the formula:

#### Acceptance Limits and Dispensing Zone

- When the adhesive model is loaded, the System Manager displays the recommended mix ratio and applies default upper and lower acceptance limits.

- These limits define the dispensing zone used by the light indicator.

- Upper and lower limits can be adjusted to best fit your dispensing process.

#### Need guidance on setting dispense zone limits?

Refer to the technical guide for best practices on defining upper and lower acceptance limits based on volumetric ratio and purge guidance.

Considerations for defining the dispense zone &rarr; 

## What the Sensor Response Tells You About Your Dispensing Process

The sensor response provides actionable insight into dispensing behavior at different points in the process. Interpreting this response over time helps identify off-ratio conditions, purge requirements, and process stability.

### Start of Dispense

At the beginning of the dispensing process, the sensor response provides information on the current mix ratio, expressed as the base part fraction (BPF). This feedback is useful for determining how much adhesive must be purged before the correct mix ratio is achieved.

Figure illustrates a scenario where the material is initially off-ratio at the start of dispensing. In this case, continue purging the adhesive until the sensor response enters the specified dispense zone, indicating that the desired mix ratio has been achieved.

### During the Dispensing Process (Continuous Dispensing Cycle)

Using the 3M&trade; Adhesive Mix Monitor during dispensing allows you to track adhesive mix ratio throughout the dispensing cycle. Figure below shows an example of a continuous dispensing cycle, where the sensor response is continuously monitored and the dispensed adhesive remains within the predefined dispense zone during dispensing.

This illustrates a continuous dispensing cycle in which the sensor response remains within the predefined dispense zone. This indicates stable mix ratio control throughout the dispensing process and confirms that the adhesive being applied meets the specified mix quality requirements.

#### Additional Example: Sensor Response Drift During Continuous Dispensing

The 3M&trade; Adhesive Mix Monitor can also provide insight to help optimize your dispensing process. When using fast-curing adhesives and dispensing continuously at low flow rates, a steady increase or decrease in sensor response may be observed during dispensing.

A steady increase or decrease in sensor response during continuous dispensing at lower flow rates may indicate that the adhesive is beginning to cure within the static mixer. To improve consistency and maintain stable mix quality, increasing the dispensing flow rate can help reduce in-mixer curing and stabilize the sensor response.

### During the Dispensing Process (Start/Stop Dispensing Cycle)

The 3M&trade; Adhesive Mix Monitor provides useful insight in processes that involve multiple start/stop events, particularly when dispensing fast-curing adhesives. Each dispensing start shows up as a peak in the sensor response, making it easier to link sensor data to the specific parts being produced. When dispensing is paused, changes in sensor response (increase or decrease) may be observed as the adhesive begins to cure in the static mixer or dispensing path.

Figure shows that the fast-curing nature of the adhesive results in a decrease in sensor response and a corresponding increase in temperature when dispensing stops, indicating the onset of curing. This information can be used to guide purge decisions prior to dispensing on the next part. The zoomed-in region highlights a prolonged wait time before the next dispense cycle, which can lead to inconsistencies in adhesive application compared to earlier parts. In such cases, purging adhesive until the sensor response aligns with prior in-spec data can help restore consistency before resuming dispensing.

#### Best Practices for Accurate Sensor Response

- Ensure the adhesive temperature is between 15&deg;C (59&deg;F) and 35&deg;C (95&deg;F) during dispensing.

- Verify that the adhesive model loaded on the processing unit matches the adhesive being dispensed.

- Always replace the sensor at the same time as the static mixer. Do not reuse sensors.
