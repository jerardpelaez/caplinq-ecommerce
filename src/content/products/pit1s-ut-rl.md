shortDescription: "LINQTAPE™ PIT1S-UT-RL is a balanced, very thin and adjustable tape. It combines our 1-mil (25.4 micron) thick polyimide film – the generic equivalent of DuPont® Kapton™ HN tape – with an ultra thin 0.5mil (12.7 micron) silicone pressure adhesive and a release liner. This combination makes the PIT1S-UT-RL a very thin film with great breakdown voltage and a total thickness of only 1.5 mil (38.1µm). A product with excellent adhesion and electrical strength at high temperatures. LINQTAPE™ PIT1S-UT-RL tapes are high performance, temperature resistant polyimide tapes that use a polyimide film as a backing film. This backing film is the generic version of DuPont's Kapton HN film and is thin at 1mil (25.4µm) yet is just as flame retardant as its thicker counterparts. Laminated to this is a 0.5mil (12.7µm) thick pressure sensitive silicone adhesive making the total thickness of the polyimide film plus adhesive only 1.5mil (38.1µm) thick. PIT1S-UT-RL remains both electrically and mechanically stable across temperatures ranging from -269°C to 400°C (-452°F to 752°F). Product Applications Polyimide tape is widely used in applications requiring high electrical insulation and an excellent balance of thermal, mechanical, chemical and electrical properties. As a base material, polyimide is extremely versatile as it can be die-cut, punched and thermoformed with or without adhesive. It is extremely well suited, and extensively used for wrapping cable and magnet wire. A further list of applications includes, but is not limited to aircraft and spacecraft wiring, insulation tubing, slot insulation, fiber optics cable, heater circuits, automotive diaphragms and manifolds, high temperature splicing and other applications that can make use of the ultra-thin, high temperature, electrically insulating properties of the PIT1S-UT-RL polyimide HN tapes.
