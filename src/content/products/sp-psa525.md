shortDescription: LINQALLOY SP-PSA525 is a high-lead, no clean solder paste composed of 5% Sn, 92.5% Pb, and 2.5% Ag. It has been designed for die-attach processes (custom viscosity and particle size) and allows reliable, clog-free dispensing of consistent deposits with automated dispensing equipment. Using a high-temperature alloy, this product is able to give superior wetting capabilities and gives high solder joint strength. This solder paste is suitable for power semiconductor die attach applications. LINQALLOY SP-PSA525 solder paste is being offered as a no-clean solder paste. No-clean solder paste is designed for applications where post-soldering cleaning is unnecessary, providing minimal, non-conductive residues. It comes with both ROL0 and ROL1 flux types.
