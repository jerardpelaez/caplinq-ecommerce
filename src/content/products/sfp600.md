shortDescription: "LINQCELL SFP600 is a substantial 600μm Stainless Steel Fiber Felt, expertly crafted to meet the highest quality standards. Its non-woven media is constructed through a process of randomly laying short stainless steel fibers, followed by sintering and bonding, resulting in an exceptionally durable and efficient material. This thicker felt is ideally suited for applications that demand superior filtration under extreme conditions, such as high pressure, elevated temperatures, and corrosive environments. The additional thickness enhances its performance and lifespan compared to finer felts. Applications: SFP600 excels in applications that require deeper filtration and increased durability: Purification of polymers and polyester melt Electronic dust collection for gases with high temperatures Protection filters for vacuum pumps Filtering fuels for aircraft and ships Radiation of materials for manufacturing burners Ventilations in nuclear applications"
