shortDescription: LOCTITE ABLESTIK 566K is a white, heat curable epoxy film, designed for bonding disimilar materials with mismatched coefficients of thermal expansion. It is electrically insulating, extremely flexible and cures in a low temperature. In fact, the lowest temperature curing and dielectric assembly film with enhanced ~1 W/m-K thermal conductivity we can offer is LOCTITE ABLESTIK 566K. LOCTITE ABLESTIK 566K is a low temperature cure version of LOCTITE ABLESTIK 561K adhesive. It is mainly used for heat sink assembly and has a glass fabric carrier. Cure Schedule 2 hours @ 100°C 3 hours @ 90°C (2 - 10psi for void free bondline)

### How does ABLESTIK 566K compare to ABLESTIK 561K?


The storage temperature of both materials is as low as -40 °C to guarantee its material properties over a longer range of time. The 561K is a great reference material that can be stored at -40 °C for 12 months but can also be stored at ambient (25 °C) for up to 6 months without loss of performance. The difference with 561K however, in the higher minimum cure schedule of 125 °C for 2 hours. The 566K material can cure at 100 °C but this is achieved by an increased catalyst load making the material more reactive, giving it shorter shelf life. (We would expect -20 °C storage to be sufficient for the 566K for 3-6 months)


Essentially you end up with two options:



- Use 561K with 6 months storage at 25 °C and accept a higher 125 °C cure

- Use 566K with 3-6 months storage at -20 °C and cure at 100 °C
