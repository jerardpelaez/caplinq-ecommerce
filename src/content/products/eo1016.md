shortDescription: LOCTITE® ECCOBOND EO1016 is an epoxy encapsulant intended for applications requiring excellent handling properties. The cured material survives severe thermal shock and offers continuous service to 177 °C. It is particularly suited for use on transistors and similar semiconductors, can be used for encapsulation of watch ICs. Additionally it exhibits a UL94V-0 rating and its non abrasive filler allows for grinding when this is necessary. It is an ideal product for glob top smartcard encapsulation. LOCTITE® ECCOBOND EO1016 was used for years in the Swiss Watch making industry and was the Glob Top used to encapsulate the Watch ICs. An important difference with this product is that it is a "EO" family which stands for "Epoxy One Component" which means that it is premixed and refrigerated. The storage temperature of this product is only refrigerated 5C as opposed to the more reactive -40C products. Cure Schedule 20 minutes @ 150°C 24 hours @ 93°C

We have internal information showing that these legacy materials pass UL94V0 but do not have the test data or yellow card nor are we going to test for it. This is anecdotal but, hopefully, helpful.
