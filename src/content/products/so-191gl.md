shortDescription: "LINQBOND SO-191GL is a single-component, moisture-curing, modified silicone adhesive, engineered for robust substrate bonding across diverse materials including polymers, metals, and silica-based composites. LINQBOND SO-191GL formulation contains alkoxy functional groups, leading to rapid curing upon exposure to ambient atmospheric moisture. Product Key Features: Rapid Curing: Achieves cure state quickly through reaction with atmospheric moisture. Odorless Formulation: Designed for use in environments sensitive to volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Enhanced Adhesion Properties: Exhibits superior bond strength compared to conventional silicone adhesives. Diverse Substrate Compatibility: Establishes strong bonds with a variety of materials, including plastics, metals, and glass. Applications Bonding components within electronic devices General industrial bonding and sealing of glass components"

Directions for Use



- Apply to a clean surface which should be free of dirt, grease or mold release. In many cases, a simple solvent wipe is sufficient.

- Pour or brush this product onto the substrates. It is not recommend to stir it onto the substrates to avoid formation of air bubbles. This product will be cured through air-drying but propeties depend on its thickness, curing temperatrue, and relative humidity.

- Use this product as soon as possible after opening the original package. When not in use, please replace the lid tightly and store in a cool and dry place.

- Cure time depends on part geometry, materials to be bonded, bondline thickness, and humidity. Cure schedule should be in accordance with actual specifications of production parts and equipment.

- Cured product is safe for contact with human skin.
