shortDescription: "LINQSOL BCP-1507 with its optimized gel time and flow ,builds up quickly and performs excellent coating results. With a wide coating thickness range of 0.1 ~ 2.0 mm, it could be used for both low (600V) and medium-voltage (38kV) busbar applications. Colors are available in orange (RAL2003), red, black (RAL9005), blue and green. It is especially suitable for EV busbars and small busbars applications. The low heat capacity of small busbars limit the dipping times, thus it requires coating powders low pick-up temperature and high build rate, which BCP-1507 aims at. BCP-1507 meets the UL 746B Relative Thermal Index (RTI) of 105°C and CTI 600V. For large busbar applications, we recommend BCP-1509. Key Features: One-powder solution from low to medium voltage Comparable with DK15-0606/DK15-0907 Good adhesion to copper, alumina Good flowability and low viscosity while melting Low pick up temperature High powder build rate (able to reach 0.5mm with 1 dip) Both electrostatic spray and fluidized bed coating Recommended coating Temperature: 180 – 230 °C. (200 °C x 30 min) Additional Information: Linqsol busbar coating products selection guide BCP-1507 coating test results"

OBSERVATION



- Coating appearance: Smooth, no-sag, no-dripping, great edge coverage

- Coating process: Quick build rate on thickness

- Suitable thickness: both thin and thick thickness (>1mm)




DISCUSSION


BCP-1507 presents excellent coating performance with dielectric strength. It is highly potential to coat more than 2mm on large size busbars or copper busbars.













### Storage


Store in a ventilated, dry, and clean environment below 25°C. Keep away from fire and heat sources. It is strictly forbidden to store in outdoor environments. At proper storage conditions, the product has a shelf life of 6 months.


### Precautions



- Avoid long-term skin contact. Powder that touched the skin should be rinsed off quickly.

- During operation dust-proof masks should be used to avoid inhalation.

- Keep the oven temperature stable, so as not to affect the colour and quality of the coating due to excessive temperature deviation.

- The concentration of dust should be controlled within a safe range to avoid malfunction of the coating equipment.
