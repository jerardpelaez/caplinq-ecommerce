shortDescription: LOCTITE 3626M is an adhesive specifically designed to bond surface-mounted devices to printed circuit boards before wave soldering. This material provides excellent dot size and shape control, whether it is used for hand print or machine print process with a stencil. LOCTITE 3626M is also halogen-free and offers very high thermal mechanical strength, even at temperatures up to 260°C. Recommended conditions for curing are exposure to heat above 100℃, (minimum 120 seconds at 130°C or 90 secs at 150°C at the bondline). Product Key Features Formulated for precise dot size and shape control. High Thermal Strength — Maintains strength even at temperatures as high as 260°C. Halogen-free formulation. Applications Bonding surface-mounted devices (SMDs) to printed circuit boards (PCBs). Use with hand print or machine print stencil processes. Secure components before the wave soldering process.

Technical Performance Data

## LOCTITE 3626M Additional Technical Information

 

Figure 1. Cure Speed vs. Time & Temperature

Figure 2. Hot Strength vs. Temperature

### Directions for Syringe Dispense Use

- Supplied de-aerated in ready-to-use syringes for air pressure/time systems.

- Equilibration: Allow 2 to 4 hours to reach room temperature after refrigeration.

- Ensure nozzles and adapters are thoroughly cleaned to avoid cross-contamination.

- Do not leave dirty nozzles on equipment or soak in solvents for long periods.

- Dispense quantity depends on pressure, time, nozzle size, and temperature.

- Parameters vary by system; optimize accordingly.

- Temperature Control: Target 30&deg;C to 35&deg;C for optimum results.

- Compatible with positive displacement pump systems.

- Not recommended for pin transfer application.

- Clean uncured adhesive with isopropanol, MEK, or LOCTITE&reg; 7360.

### Directions for Stencil Print Use

- Suitable for open squeegee and enclosed systems (ProFlow&reg;, PumpPrint&reg;). Print speeds: 20 mm/s to 150 mm/s.

- Equilibration: Allow 2 to 4 hours to reach room temperature before use.

- Environment: Ideal conditions are 25&deg;C and 5 mins.

- Automatic under-stencil-wipe is not recommended.

- Cured adhesive can only be removed mechanically with heat.

Typical Starting Parameters (Steel Stencil/Squeegee)

*For higher dots, Print and Flood Mode can be used. Set rear squeegee pressure to 0 kg to leave a 1-2 mm adhesive layer on the stencil.
