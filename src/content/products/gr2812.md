shortDescription: Hysol GR2812 is a gold, silica filled (90%) semiconductor epoxy molding compound designed for the encapsulation and protection of thin walled conductive polymer tantalum solid capacitors (POSCAP). Once molded and post-mold cured, this product provides optimium protection and reliability for these capacitor devices Hysol GR2812 is designed for Conductive Polymer Tantalum Solid Capacitors (POSCAP). In the world of passive components, POSCAPs are relatively new to the scene. These solid electrolytic capacitors have many advantages, but offer challenges for epoxy mold compound manufacturers. The two main challenges are for these devices are thin wall crack resistance as well as MSL3 260°C capability. Furthermore, it must be fast-cure in order to be optimized for automolding equipment. Hysol GR2812 replaces GR2811. It is the next generation of environmentally "green" products from Hysol. The previous generation GR2811 was able to withstand thin-wall crack resistance, but was not able to pass MSL3 260°C JEDEC reflow. After several trials and developments, Hysol successfully developed GR2812 which passes the electrical requirements of Conductive Polymer Tanatalum Capacitors, but also withstands JEDEC level MSL3 260°C reflow thin wall crack resistance. Hysol GR2812 does not contain any bromine, antimony or phosphorus flame retardants, making it still an environmetally "green" halogen-free epoxy mold compound. This next generation epoxy mold compound replaces older generation products of GR2811, but also the non-halogen containing predecessors MG33F-0520 and MG33F-0602. This material is designed to achieve JEDEC Level 3 requirements at 260°C reflow temperature on conductive polymer capacitors. It's fast cure time also ensures that it is compatible with the latest automold manufacturing equipment. Hysol GR2812 meets UL 94 V-0 Flammability at 1/4 inch (6.35mm) thickness.
