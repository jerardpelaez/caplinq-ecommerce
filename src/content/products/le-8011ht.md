To meet higher application requirements, liquid encapsulation is expected to have (1) excellent thermal stability; (2) low transmittance decay. Our resin technology could help meet these challenges. With the resin improved in LE-8011HT, the pot life increased (~7 hours), and viscosity decreased (~400-800 cP). LE-8011HT is a Visible light-blocking encapsulation based on the optically clear version LE-8011U product platform, both products remain with superior anti-blue decay and thermal aging stability. Worth to be mentioned, the properties of both products remains within the same range, apart from their appearance in color and optical performance.




### OPTOLINQ LE-8011HT | Visible Light Blocking


LE-8011HT is developed based on LE-8011U, thus LE-8011HT keeps UV-blocking properties as LE-8011U.




### OPTOLINQ LE-8011U | Optically Clear-UV Light Blocking


Optically clear encapsulation with stable UV blocking capabilities.






 

 



### LE-8011U | UV Aging Performance


LE-8011HT has superior anti-blue decay properties as LE-8011U.




### LE-8011U | Thermal Aging Performance


Optically clear encapsulation with stable UV blocking capabilities.











Processing Instructions



- Mix components A and B in a 100:95 weight ratio and stir uniformly. Ensure that the mixture is uniform and free from streaks or unevenness.

- Defoam the mixture under vacuum conditions for 5 minutes.

- Recommended curing condition: First cure at 130 °C for 1 hour, then post cure at 150 °C for 4 hours.




Curing conditions should be determined according to the specific needs of the package being encapsulated, the conditions mentioned are for reference only.




Storage and Handling


The uncured resin can be cleaned with acetone or a suitable cleaning agent. Water cannot be used as cleaning agent. Store in a cold, dry, and clean environment between 10–30 °C with relative humidity below 70%. Keep away from exposure to direct sunlight. It is strictly forbidden to store in outdoor environments. At proper storage conditions, unopened Part A and Part B have a shelf life of 12 months.
