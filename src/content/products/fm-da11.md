shortDescription: "Silaplane® FM-DA11 is a reactive polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) based polymer with a molecular weight of 1,000 g/mol and a Viscosity of 60 mPas. This reactive silicone material offers the addition of silicone-type properties to non-Silicone materials in a variety of industries including electronics, semiconductors, automotive, biotech, healthcare, and clean energy applications. It offers narrow polydispersity and a low level of chemical impurities Silaplane® FM-DA11 mono-terminal product has a Hydroxy (Diol) functional group that is reactive toward a variety of compounds and surfaces enabling chemical and physical changes to chemicals, particle surfaces and larger surface structures. Hydroxy groups are mainly reacting with Urethane and Ester compounds. The reactive functional group improves the adsorption to the filler surface and makes the inorganic filler easier to blend into the silicone binder resin. At the same time it displays high affinity for the silicone binder resin which improves the wettability between the filler and the binder. This product stabilizes the filler dispersion due to the repulsive force between fillers, achieved by silicone repulsion and the osmotic pressure effect. Product Benefits: Filler dispersion stabilization with low viscosity Water/Oil repellency Gas permeability (Oxygen, CO2, CH4, etc.) Mold releasability Anti-Abrasion resistance, Anti-fouling"
