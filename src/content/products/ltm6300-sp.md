shortDescription: LTM6300-SP is the entry level Honeywell's thermally conductive phase change Stencil printable paste. This paste is designed to minimize thermal resistance at interfaces and maintain extremely stable performance through reliability testing required for long product life applications. In addition to that it has excellent electrical properties and the highest volume resistivity of the entire phase change product line. LTM6300-SP has a Thermal conductivity of 1.8 - 2.4 (W/m·K) depending on the bondline thickness and is based on a robust polymer PCM structure that exhibits excellent wetting properties during typical operating temperature ranges, resulting in very low surface contact resistance. The proprietary material provides superior reliability and maintains low thermal impedance (0.12-0.14) , making it desirable for high-performance integrated circuit devices.

When choosing a printable paste it is important to understand the process parameters and limitations.


That's why we ask, when you contact us, to include the following information:



- What is your print thickness?

- How long is your printing time and working window?

What is your drying step after printing?


- Temperature (Room temperature or something else?)

- Time




- Do you have any viscosity limitations in the printing process?
