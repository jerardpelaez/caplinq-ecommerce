shortDescription: PEAM-1769 is a polyester acrylate/methacrylate that exhibits excellent adhesion, low warpage, and hydrophobicity. The oligomer has very high thermal stability and low volatility. It can be used as a base oligomer in a formulation or an additive. It is dark amber-colored, something that needs to be considered for light cure application. PEAM-1769 is recommended for use as a base resin or an additive to reduce stress. It has excellent adhesion on most substrates with low stress and low shrinkage due to its high Tg polycyclic repeat units. The oligomer has good solubility in both aliphatic and aromatic solvents and monomers.
