shortDescription: Honeywell RTM-X22, a pluggable thermally conductive Phase Change Material (PCM), offers multiple pluggable performance. It is designed to minimize thermal resistance at interfaces, maintain excellent performance through reliability testing, and provide scalable application at a competitive cost. Based on a novel polymer PCM system, Polyimide (PI) film was used as substrate, allowing direct contact of PCM to provide multiple pluggable performance. The edge is coated with pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA) to provide adhesion with other devices. This material exhibits excellent wetting at interfaces during typical operating temperature ranges, resulting in very low surface contact resistance. Honeywell RTM-X22 Pluggable TIM for pluggable optical modules reduces operational temperature and can withstand repeated mechanical insertions. We can share a plethora of Technical Information with a signed NDA. Contact us for more information.
