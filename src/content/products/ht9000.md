shortDescription: HT9000 is one the newest additions in our product line. It is a Silicone based one-part Gap Filler provides a thermal conductivity of 9.0 W/m·K along with high compressibility. It is formulated to deliver high dispense rates for improved productivity, long-term reliability performance and to be easily reworkable. HT9000 maintains excellent performance through reliability testing, and provide scalable applications at a competitive cost. Additionally it performs great in oil,crack and slump testing and it exhibits no pump out and cracking risk. You probably noticed the lack of information and specific product properties such as BLT, dispense rate and Thermal impedance. Since those are top of the line products, we go to certain extends to protect Honeywell's IP and competitive advantages. A plethora of information, including additional data, images and samples are available once an NDA is in place. Contact us for more details.
