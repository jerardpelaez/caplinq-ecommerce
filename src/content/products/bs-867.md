shortDescription: "Thermelt 867 Black is a pure copolymer polyamide hot melt resin, non-reactive and solvent-free, engineered specifically for low pressure molding (LPM) applications. Optimized for both automotive and electronic environments, Thermelt 867 combines excellent process versatility with high-performance thermal, mechanical, and electrical properties. Its enhanced thermal resistance and UL94 V-0 flammability rating make it a preferred choice for overmolding connectors, cable assemblies, and sensitive electronic modules requiring robust environmental protection and electrical insulation. Thermelt 867 was developed specifically for improving adhesion on a wide range of substrates and offers cohesiveness at negative temperatures (-50°C). It is mainly used for molding electronic/electric components, connectors and cables. Typical Applications: Overmolding of automotive sensors, ECUs, and wire harnesses Encapsulation of printed circuit boards (PCBs) and electrical components Strain relief and environmental protection of connectors and terminals"
