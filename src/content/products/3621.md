shortDescription: "LOCTITE 3621 epoxy adhesive is a Chipbonder designed for the bonding of surface mounted devices to printed circuit boards prior to wave soldering. Particularly suited for applications where very high dispense speeds, high dot profile, high wet strength and good electrical characteristics are required. Particularly suited where dispense speeds greater than 35,000 dots/h are required. Dispense speed ranges from 25000 to 50000 dots per hour. LOCTITE 3621 has been used successfully for small part bonding in lead free processes with water and alcohol based fluxes under conditions outlined in the Environmental Resistance section. Cure schedule 30 minutes @ 150°C Note: Sufficient time must be added to allow the bond location to reach the desired cure temperature. Curing profiles should be developed for each device. Bond strength achieved in practice will vary considerably depending on the SMD component type, adhesive dot size and the type, grade and degree of cure of the solder mask/resist."
