Precautions for Use





This product needs to be stored at low temperatures and at dry places. The shelf life will vary depending on the storage conditions.




Before use, allow the material to reach room temperature (15–25 °C, 25–55% RH) for at least 2 to 4 hours, ensuring the packaging is unopened to prevent moisture contamination—thawing time of approximately 2 hours for small packaging (30g). for larger quantities, it may take around 4 hours.




Preheat the material at 40-60°C for about 30-60 minutes

****


Maintain a clean and ventilated workplace with proper ventilation and exhaust system..




Wear appropriate safety equipment before use and avoid direct contact with the body. Please read the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) carefully before using.


- For standard applications using the single-step cure is sufficient and efficient. However for high-performance applications and thermally-sensitive packages and substrate please conduct specific tests to arrive at conditions suitable for the package.






Storage and Handling


Store in a cold, dry, and clean environment, ideally at –10 °C or lower with relative humidity below 70%. Keep away from exposure to direct sunlight. It is strictly forbidden to store in outdoor environments. At proper storage conditions, unopened material has a shelf life of 3 months.
