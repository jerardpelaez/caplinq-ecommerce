shortDescription: PTM7900 is designed to minimize thermal resistance at interfaces and maintain extremely stable performance through reliability testing required for long product life applications. It has stable Thermal Impedance across accelerated aging tests and does not display bleed, pump or flow out. PTM7XXX product line has the highest Thermal conductivity and lowest thermal impedance out of the entire PTM Series PTM7900 has a Thermal conductivity of 8.0 (W/m·K) depending on the bondline thickness and is based on a robust polymer PCM structure that exhibits excellent wetting properties during typical operating temperature ranges, resulting in very low surface contact resistance. This proprietary material provides superior reliability and maintains low thermal impedance (0.045) , making it desirable for high-performance integrated circuit devices. It has been qualified from major GPU and cooling solution manufacturers across the globe. PTM7900 is almost as good as it gets. The only product that has slightly better thermal properties is PTM7950 which reaches 8.5 W/m·K and 0.04 TI and is designed for extremely demanding and tight applications. PTM7900 and PTM7950 are closely related thermal interface materials with slight differences in performance. PTM7950 features a softer composition, higher thermal conductivity, and lower thermal impedance, enhancing its overall thermal performance. Aside from these improvements, both materials share similar characteristics.

### What are the reliability expectations of the PTM 7XXX products?


All the 7XXXseries (7000, 7900 & 7950) pass the three major reliability tests with flying colours. Honeywell does not test beyond 1000 cycles, 92 hrs HAST and 1000 hrs HTS. However, anecdotally, some automotive customers have taken 7900 to beyond Honeywell’s limits and have found it to pass shock and vibration, longer temperature cycling and longer temperature and humidity soak.
If your lifetime performance is defined mainly by power cycling, then you also check the 6000 series which will have the longest life.
 
The main difference between the 7XXX products is the filler content which makes 7950 the most conductive.
