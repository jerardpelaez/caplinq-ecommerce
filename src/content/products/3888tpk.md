### What is a Twinpak?


TwinPaks are part A and B in the same package, separated by a plastic bar. (think of it like what you do to seal half-eaten bags of potato chips). The bar (once removed) is then used to mix A and B together. Once they are mixed, the corner of the pack is cut and the "b-stage epoxy" is applied to the part.
