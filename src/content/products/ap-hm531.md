shortDescription: Kester HM531 is a halide-free, organic acid, water-soluble solder paste that provides users with the highest level of consistency and performance. Batch after batch, HM531 provides hours of stable stencil life, tack time and repeatable brick definition. HM531's robust printing characteristics result in consistent solder paste volume regardless of idle time, stencil life and print speed. The activator package in HM531 is very aggressive and provides superior wetting to OSP-coated PCBs and PdAg components. The outstanding batch consistency, anti-slump chemistry, consistent print volumes, solderability and cleanability make the HM531 an ideal water-soluble solder paste for any application. KESTER HM531 is classified as ORM0. Product Key Features Outstanding batch-to-batch consistency Excellent anti-slump characteristics Excellent solderability 8+ hour stencil life Minimal voiding underneath BGA components Applicactions Stencil printing and enclosed head printing (90% metal)

### Reflow Profile

The recommended reflow profile for HM531 made with either the Sn63Pb37 or Sn62Pb36Ag02 is shown here. This profile is simply a guideline. Since HM531 is a highly active, water soluble solder paste, it can solder effectively over a wide range of profiles. HM531 is capable of reflowing at the 235 &deg;C peak temperatures required for fully collapsing lead-free SAC BGA&rsquo;s for maximum reliability and remains easy to clean after these high temperature profiles. Your optimal profile may be different from the one shown based on your own, board and mix of defects. Please contact us if you need additional profiling advice.

Peak Temp: 210&ndash;230 &deg;C

Zones:

- Soaking Zone: 170&ndash;180 &deg;C, 60&ndash;90 sec typical

- Reflow Zone: 6&ndash;75 sec typical

Time to Peak Temperature: 3.5&ndash;6 min typical

Ramp-up: <1.5 &deg;C/sec
