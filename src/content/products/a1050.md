shortDescription: A-1050 (Part number A-6150) is a proprietary non-halogenated additive designed to reduce resin bleed out on a variety of surfaces with minimal or no affect on the adhesion properties of the formulation. It shows excellent results when used with metal filler systems such as silver. It also shows improved bleed properties with non-metal filled systems. It is co-curable in free-radical polymerization. It also can enhance the rheological properties of various filled adhesives.dhesives. A-1050 is recommended for use as an additive to reduce resin bleed out specifically on metal surfaces. The recommended addition of the A-1050 to a formulation is between 0.5% - 1% weight percent of resin. It shows superior bleed control in silver filled formulations and can significantly reduce or eliminate resin bleed out in formulations that contain non-metal fillers such as silica. The addition of the A-1050 has also shown to significantly increase the thixotropic nature of silver filled adhesives.

A1050 Vs A1100 (Parts #A6150 vs #A6265)


A1050 and A1100 are similar in that they have acid functionality and are both good for metal surfaces. Of the two A1050 has been used successfully by industry leading sealant companies and is now used by major conductive die attach paste manufacturers. A1050 has a more extensive track record while A1100 is a similar and potentially better alternative that is currently implemented in new processes.


Epoxy Resin Incompatibility


A1050 rely on acid functionality to bond in and prevent bleeding. Unfortunately thiol group react with epoxy resin instead of substrate reducing or even eliminating the resin bleed functionality.


Molecular Weight Estimation


We do not specifically measure the M.W. for this material and instead rely on the average M.W. of the starting material and the functionality (thiol group) that makes the product.
