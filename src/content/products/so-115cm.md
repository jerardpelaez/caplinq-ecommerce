Directions for Use



- Apply to a clean surface which should be free of dirt, grease or mold release. In many cases, a simple solvent wipe is sufficient.

- Pour or brush this product onto the substrates. It is not recommend to stir it onto the substrates to avoid formation of air bubbles. This product will be cured through air-drying but propeties depend on its thickness, curing temperatrue, and relative humidity.

- After bonding, do not move the substrate for one to two hours. It is expected to initially cure between 12-24 hours. If the layer is thick, the initial curing time will be longer.

- Use this product as soon as possible after opening the original package. When not in use, please replace the lid tightly and store in a cool and dry place.

- Cure time depends on part geometry, materials to be bonded, bondline thickness, and humidity. Cure schedule should be in accordance with actual specifications of production parts and equipment.
