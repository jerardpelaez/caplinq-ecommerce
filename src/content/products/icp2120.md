shortDescription: LOCTITE ABLESTIK ICP 2120 silver filled silicone MS polymer is developed for conductive bonding in high-volume consumer devices (curing at 50° Celsius and lower by moisture) . It shows excellent adhesion in interfaces such as SUS and Nickel. LOCTITE ABLESTIK ICP 2120 displays excellent DCR and VR performance. It has a very high thermal conductivity (7 W/mK) and low tensile modulus. This silicon adhesive is used for low temp/moisture curable application for CCM bracket grounding. LOCTITE ABLESTIK ICP 2120 is a low modulus ECA which will cure at temperatures between 25°C and 50°C by moisture and or heat. As such it can be a good option for battery applications requiring a maximum of 60°C curing temperature. Cure Schedule 30min @ 50°C

LOCTITE ABLESTIK ICP is an electrically-conductive adhesive (ECA) designed to for use with heat-sensitive components often found within compact camera module (CCM) structures for mobile devices. The room temperature, moisture cure capability of the material protects delicate substrates, while providing excellent electrical conductivity, low direct contact resistance (DCR) and good dispensing performance for high-volume production environments.



- Enables high yield and mass production of production of thin, delicate, heat-sensitive devices

- Facilitates robust CCM operation with excellent electrical grounding performance and protection against ESD

- High reliability electrical and thermal performance

- Highly stable for production adaptability
