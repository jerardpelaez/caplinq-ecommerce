shortDescription: "LINQALLOY SP-SAC305 is a lead free, no clean, solder paste that has been designed for Surface Mount Technology(SMT). SP-SAC305 is available in 4 different options: SP-SAC305NC, SP-SAC305RMA, SP-SAC305RA and SP-SAC305WS. LINQALLOY SP-SAC305-NC is designed for applications where post-soldering cleaning is unnecessary, providing minimal, non-conductive residues.This solder paste is crafted with refined tin powder that allows for exceptional printing capabilities and minimal oxide content. This solder paste has enhanced flux content (higher %) that guarantees higher reliability. With is low iconic activator system it leaves behind minimal residues post reflow resulting in exceptionally high insulation resistance and excellent reliability. LINQALLOY SP-SAC305-RMA is ideal for applications where minimal residue is acceptable, without the need for rigorous cleaning.This solder paste is crafted with refined tin powder that allows for exceptional printing capabilities and minimal oxide content. This solder paste has enhanced flux content (higher %) that guarantees higher reliability. With is low iconic activator system it leaves behind minimal residues post reflow resulting in exceptionally high insulation resistance and excellent reliability. LINQALLOY SP-SAC305-RA offers good wetting properties and versatility for a wide range of applications. This solder paste is crafted with refined tin powder that allows for exceptional printing capabilities and minimal oxide content. This solder paste has enhanced flux content (higher %) that guarantees higher reliability. With its low iconic activator system it leaves behind minimal residues post reflow resulting in exceptionally high insulation resistance and excellent reliability. LINQALLOY SP-SAC305-WS is crafted with refined tin powder that allows for exceptional requirement to clean flux residue left after the reflow process. The removal of the solder flux is crucial for certain high risk application to ensure the PCB board is free from elements which can cause problems. This solder paste has enhanced flux content (higher %) that guarantees higher reliability, with low iconic activator system."
