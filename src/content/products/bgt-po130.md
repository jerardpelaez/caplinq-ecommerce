shortDescription: LINQTAPE™ BGT-PO130 is a blue translucent polyolefin (PO) tape used in the wafer back grinding process. It is compatible to the BG standard, and is highly accurate. The tape provides an excellent balance of electrical, mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties. PO tapes have the same strong adhesion as a PET tape but are more easily removed from the substrate. This makes it ideal for applications where easy removal without any residue left behind is required. BGT-PO130 is has a low-viscosity adhesive, and is resistant to warpage. LINQTAPE™ BGT-PO130 is a 100µm PO film, with a one-sided 30µm acrylic adhesive layer, and backed with a PET liner. This product can be customized according to the customer's needs. Key Features Back grinding standard compatible Strong adhesion to prevent substrate damage Can be used with uneven surfaces Antistatic High transparency High flexibility High chemical resistance No residue after removal Application Ideas Back grinding Masking Temporary bonding Assembly of delicate components Packaging substrates Glass (e.g. optical applications)
