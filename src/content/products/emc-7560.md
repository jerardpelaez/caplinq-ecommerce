shortDescription: "LINQSOL EMC-7560 is a black, halogen-free epoxy molding compound designed for high-voltage and high-temperature semiconductor applications. It adopts a multifunctional epoxy system with a hydrophobic hardener and a new type of stress modifier that utilizes a super dispersion technology. With a high glass transition temperature (Tg = 205 °C), low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), and low modulus, EMC-7560 ensures robust performance. EMC-7560 boasts low moisture absorption (LINQSOL EMC-7560 finds its niche in high-voltage and high-power discrete packages, including but not limited to TO220, TO247, and other surface mount devices. It enables SiC power modules to pass and perform well in H(3)TRB, HTGB, and HTOL tests. Its innovative epoxy system, which features a high-density molecule matrix, minimizes ion diffusion, ensuring enhanced reliability and superior performance in challenging HTRB and H3TRB conditions. This material has a CTI of 600V. Key Features: High temperature stability with high Tg (205 °C) Excellent electrical stability due to low ion content and mobility Low stress with low CTE (10 ppm) and low modulus Low moisture absorption and low mold shrinkage (Halogen-free (does not contain Br, Sb, P) UL 94 V-0 Flammability Application: SiC MOSFETs; TO-package Devices"
