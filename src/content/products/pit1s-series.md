### Typical Applications






Comparing with Kapton tape with acrylic adhesive (PIT1A series), silicone adhesives tape can withstand higher temperature range as compared to acrylic adhesives, which provide a wider appilication range. Acrylics have the property of being more brittle and as such they can crack at extremely low temperatures too. Generally speaking, the acrylic adhesive will have higher adhesion at mid-range temperatures (0°C to 100°C), but silicone adhesives have higher adhesion at lower temperatures (under 0°C) and higher temperatures (above 100°C). PIT1S-Series are suitable for continous cold and high temperature environments, typical applications are:



- Masking against chemicals, heat and other hash conditions

- PCB masking for wave solder and solder reflow process

- Protective layer, ground, barrier and cross over insulation for electrical components like bobbin, toroidal coils, etc.

- End-turn bunding and connection insulation for small motors, etc.
