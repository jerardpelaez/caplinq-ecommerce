## Frequently Asked Questions About HumiSeal® 1C49



### What are typical applications for HumiSeal® 1C49?


HumiSeal® 1C49 is a general-purpose, single-component, moisture-curing, high-build silicone conformal coating used for protecting printed circuit board assemblies (PCBs) in various industries, including:



- Aerospace systems (e.g., avionics, control modules)

- Automotive electronics (e.g., engine control units, sensors)

- Industrial automation (e.g., motor drives, PLCs)

- Consumer electronics (e.g., smartphones, gaming devices)






### Why choose HumiSeal® 1C49 over other conformal coatings?


HumiSeal® 1C49 provides excellent protection, with outstanding flexibility and a VOC-free, solvent-free formulation. It provides excellent electrical insulation, fluoresces under UV for easy inspection, and is easily repairable with HumiSeal® Stripper 1091. It is also compliant with IPC-CC-830, MIL-I-46058C, and RoHS Directive 2011/65/EU, making it a trusted choice for demanding applications. You can learn how to select a conformal coating in our blog.






### What is the shelf life of HumiSeal® 1C49?


HumiSeal® 1C49 has a shelf life of 12 months from the date of manufacture when stored at or below 27°C in tightly closed containers. Prior to use, allow the product to equilibrate for 24 hours at room temperature to ensure optimal performance.




### How should I clean tools after applying HumiSeal® 1C49?


Tools and equipment used for applying HumiSeal® 1C49 (e.g., spray guns, brushes, or dipping tanks) can be cleaned with a suitable solvent, such as a mineral spirit or acetone, before the coating cures. Thinner is not required or recommended for this product. For removing the coating from PCBs during rework, use HumiSeal® Stripper 1091. Always use a lint-free cloth and ensure proper ventilation during cleaning.






### What happens to HumiSeal® 1C49 after its shelf life?


Past its 12-month shelf life, HumiSeal® 1C49 may experience changes in viscosity, which could affect application consistency and coating uniformity. Using expired product may lead to suboptimal performance, and the manufacturer will not be liable for quality or performance issues if expired material is used. If the product has cured in the container, it cannot be recovered.




### Why do curing times vary for HumiSeal® 1C49?


HumiSeal® 1C49 is a moisture-curing coating. Curing times vary depending on temperature, humidity, and film thickness. Typically, the coating will be tack-free in approximately 3 to 5 hours, and fully cured in 24 hours at room temperature. The full cure can be accelerated by using heat with an open pan of water to increase humidity, such as 20 minutes at 76°C.






### What is the recommended thickness for HumiSeal® 1C49?


The recommended coating thickness for HumiSeal® 1C49 is 50 to 200 microns. This range ensures optimal protection without compromising flexibility or electrical performance. The thickness is controlled primarily by the application method and withdrawal rate, as the coating is not designed to be thinned.




### What are the differences between application methods for HumiSeal® 1C49?


HumiSeal® 1C49 can be applied via spraying, dipping, or brushing. Spraying and dipping are ideal for large-scale production, while brushing is suited for small repairs. This product does not require thinning for any of these methods. Each method should be controlled to achieve a uniform coating, especially the withdrawal rate for dipping.






### What is the maximum operating temperature for HumiSeal® 1C49?


HumiSeal® 1C49 can withstand thermal shock from -65°C to +200°C. It is also rated for continuous operation at 200°C, making it suitable for high-temperature applications where its protective properties must be maintained under constant thermal stress.




### What safety precautions should I take when using HumiSeal® 1C49?


HumiSeal® 1C49 is VOC-free and solvent-free, reducing flammability risks. However, proper ventilation is still crucial to prevent inhalation of vapors or spray mist, especially since the coating cures via moisture in the air. Avoid skin and eye contact. Always consult the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) prior to use for detailed safety guidelines.






### How can I ensure proper application of HumiSeal® 1C49?


HumiSeal® 1C49 fluoresces under UV light, allowing for easy inspection of coating coverage. After application, use a UV light source to check for a uniform, void-free coating, which is critical for high-reliability electronics manufacturing.




### How does HumiSeal® 1C49 perform in harsh environments?


HumiSeal® 1C49 is designed for harsh conditions, with excellent fungus resistance per ASTM G21 and exceptional moisture insulation resistance. It maintains performance in humid, mechanically stressful, or temperature-cycling environments, making it ideal for mission-critical systems.
