shortDescription: "Aculon's award-winning NanoProof® Series offer customers a range of PCB waterproofing solutions from protecting against accidental water damage (NanoProof 1.0) to IPX7, immersion in water at one meter depth for 30 minutes (NanoProof® 3.5, 4.0), to greater barrier properties that can withstand 100 hours immersion in sweat solutions and some of the most stringent test methods developed for non-hermetic components (NanoProof® 5.1). Advantages of Aculon's NanoProof 5.0 Water contact angle – 120 degrees Oil contact angle – 76 degrees IPX -7 ( i.e. 30 minutes immersion at 1 meters): PASS PCB immersion in salt water >60 minutes More forgiving during application Spray or dip applied 50 μm thickness ”Push through connectivity” capability while drying only Film conductivity: megaOhm Dry time: 60 minutes at room temperature No cure required Handleable when dry More effective barrier than NanoProof 4.0 amd designed for more technically challenging aplications requiring a barrier like coating Contains UV tracer RoHS and REACH compliant Contains PFAs Application of Aculon's Nanoproof 5.0 Step 1: Clean Parts Must be sufficiently clean prior to treatment for proper bonding and effective application. Step 2: Treat Option – Spray (preferred method) Apply Aculon NanoProof® PCB Water Protection Treatment via spray gun. Aculon NanoProof® PCB Water Protection Treatment comes 1L Bottles for spray applications. Spray application typically results in treatment thickness of 50 nm - 20 µm depending on process parameters and chemistry selected. Recommended Equipment: Spray & Dispense Valve - The PVA FCS300 Valve has been tested and confirmed compatible with all NanoProof products. Manual Coating System - The PVA MCCS-SYS-1 Manual Conformal Coating System has been tested and confirmed compatible with all NanoProof products. Automated & Selective Coating - The PVA Delta 8 Selective Coating / Dispensing System has been tested and confirmed compatible with all NanoProof Products. Option - Dip Fully immerse the part in the Aculon NanoProof® PCB Water Protection Treatment solution for 30 seconds. Withdraw the part at a steady rate to ensure even coverage. Allow to dry or cure depending on your substrate. Aculon NanoProof PCB Water Protection Treatments come in convenient 1L quantities for dipping applications. Option - Disperse Dispense product over the surface. Apply enough material to coat the surface. Utilization of multiple options Please note that many customers have found significant success utilizing two or more of the available NanoProof® technologies successfully. Often times the most sensitive components benefit from the most robust NanoProof® technology (5.1) while the remaining components can be coated with the less robust coatings to benefit from their electrical push through capability, flexible nature and lower costs! Detection/Inspection All NanoProof products contain a UV Tracer which is visible under 365nm wavelength UV light (Detectable by both the human eye and automated detection systems). Please note that soldermasks and other substrate materials containing a UV tracer may make accurate detection of NanoProof difficult."
