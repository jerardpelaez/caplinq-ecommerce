sellingPoints:
  - Low stress silicone potting gel
  - Low viscosity, good leveling, and bubble-free curing
  - Excellent long term temperature resistance
shortDescription: "LINQBOND PM-4911HV is a two-component, low-stress transparent packaging adhesive. When the two components are mixed in a 1:1 ratio (by volume), they cure into a soft silicone gel. This gel offers buffering, shock absorption, insulation, waterproofing, and moisture-proof functions for electronic components. With a very low modulus, it generates minimal internal stress and exhibits robust resistance to cold and heat shock. LINQBOND PM-4911HV also exhibits excellent adhesion on various surfaces, making it suitable for insulating a wide array of electronic components. PM-4911HV is a version of PM-4911, with a higher operating temperature range and viscosity. PM-4911HV passed CTI tests with PLC 0 rating, relative thermal index (RTI) value of 150°C, and a UL 94 HB flammability rating. Applications IGBT modules Suitable for all kinds of electronic components with insulation protection and isolation of external pollutants; Protection of precision components and electronic equipment Various display potting protection Cure schedule Room temperature curing: 12 h Heat curing at 100 °C for 30–60 mins"

### Precautions before Use



- Avoid contact with condensed silicone rubber, its gas, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, and other chemicals, including heavy metals, as they may inhibit curing of the product.

- Maintain a clean and ventilated workplace, using extraction trunks when necessary.

- Wear appropriate protective equipment and minimize direct contact with the human body. Refer to the Material Safety Data Sheet (SDS) before use.




### Storage and Handling


Store in a well-ventilated, dry area below 25 °C, away from fire and heat sources. Avoid outdoor storage. For extended shelf life, consider cold storage. Shelf life is 12 months under recommended conditions.
