shortDescription: LOCTITE GC 18 is a halogen free, no-clean, low voiding, Pb-free, SAC305 solder paste specially formulated to provide low voiding when soldering Bottom-Terminated Components (BTC- QFN, DPAK and LGA). This material is a room temperature paste, designed to enhance stability in stencil printing applications. LOCTITE GC 18 offers less than 25% voiding across small and large BTC with an IPC Class III voiding for BGA/CSP. It has good resistance to graping (the appearance of unreflowed solder particles on top of the solder mass) in demanding reflow profiles, excellent humidity resistance and minimal slump at room temperature and up to 190°C. LOCTITE GC 18 offers stable on-stencil viscosity for improved printing consistence and great reliability, passing SIR and ECM independent of reflow profiles. It leaves pin-testable post-reflow residues after four reflow cycles, is compatible with approved encapsulant technologies and RoHS and EICC compliant.
