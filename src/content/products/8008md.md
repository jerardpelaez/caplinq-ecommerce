shortDescription: LOCTITE ABLESTIK 8008MD adhesive is designed for medium die attach applications. This thermally and electrically conductive proprietary hybrid product can be applied to a wafer backside by stencil printing and then B-staged in an oven. LOCTITE ABLESTIK 8008MD can then be cured after die attach in an in-line process. This material has good substrate wetting, controlled bondline thickness was originally known as RP-825-3C1. It is typically used on PPF, Copper and Silver plated CU leadframes. LOCTITE ABLESTIK 8008MD is designed as a Wafer Back side Coating for die sizes down to 150x150um and should be applied to the wafer and dried before dicing. The solvent in 8800MD should evaporate before die placement or during slow cure ramp up. Also, Instead of printing the whole wafer, we expect that 8008MD is also suitable for printing smaller dots. Cure Schedule 30 minute ramp to 175°C + 60 minutes @ 175°C
