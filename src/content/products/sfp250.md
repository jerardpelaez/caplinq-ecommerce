shortDescription: "LINQCELL SFP250 is a versatile 250μm Stainless Steel Fiber Felt designed to meet rigorous quality standards. Crafted through a meticulous process of randomly laying short stainless steel fibers, followed by sintering and bonding, it stands as a robust and efficient filtration solution. LINQCELL SFP250 excels in applications that demand durability and reliability under harsh conditions, including high pressure, elevated temperatures, and corrosive environments. Its multiple layers of stainless steel fibers can be compressed to the desired thickness, ensuring consistent performance and an extended lifespan. LINQCELL SFP250 can be coated according to your requirements. Coated stainless steels are a cost-effective alternative to titanium porous transport layers in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers. Applications: SFP250's fine pore sizes and flexibility make it ideal for various applications: Filtration in refining processes Pre-filtration in ultrafiltration operations Purification of liquids in the petroleum, food and beverage, biological, and pharmaceutical industries Support for filter membranes Heat exchange applications Filtration of viscose rayon Porous transport layers for alkaline and anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers Anode porous transport or gas diffusion electrodes for water electrolyzers Porous transport layers for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers - Alternative to titanium fiber felts Gas diffusion layers in PEM fuel cells - Alternative to graphitized carbon papers"
