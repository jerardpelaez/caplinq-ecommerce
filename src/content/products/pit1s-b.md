shortDescription: LINQTAPE PIT1S-B is a Kapton HN Alternative whose high performance, flexible, high-temperature resistant polyimide film is used for many high-temperature applications. Polyimide is preferred over polyester for many high-temperature applications. These applications include but are not limited to semiconductor, smartcard, electronic, automotive, and general manufacturing industries. LINQTAPE PIT1S-B Tape provides an excellent balance of electrical, mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties over a wide range of temperatures. Tapes are typically only limited by their adhesive. This Silicone tape can be used in applications up to 260°C. This PIT1S-B(lack) film has an opaque black coloring, which results in almost no light transmission, higher heat resistance and higher resistivity than the standard PIT1S.
