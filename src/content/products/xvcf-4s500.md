shortDescription: LINQSTAT XVCF-4S500 is a highly conductive conductive polyethylene film similar to our standard VCF-Series film but with a higher electrically conductive carbon loading and a denser polymer mix. Having a surface resistance of ±500 ohms/sq, this extra loading makes the XVCF-Series more conductive than our standard film and allows it to be used in applications that require a lower resistivity. In addition, the film is volume conductive, claiming a mere 3.5 ohms-cm volume resistivity. LINQSTAT XVCF-4S500 conductive films are thin (0.1mm or 4 mil), lightweight and relatively inert. Furthermore, they are well suited for applications requiring electrochemical reactions, high conductivity, or charge storage including but not limited to electrodes (ECG, TENS, Defibrillation and Iontophoresis), batteries (flat-cell zinc/manganese dioxide (MnO2), Lithium Ion and Lithium polymer), and digital (electronic) whiteboards. LINQSTAT XVCF-4S500 film and its conductivity are unaffected by humidity and age. The film is heat sealable, flexible and offers exceptional abrasion resistance. The film gives good thermal stability and has outstanding chemical resistance. It has a standard thickness of 100µm (4 mil) with a core inner diameter of 3" and is available in various lengths and widths upon request.

Heat sealing



- Heat sealing time: 0.5-3.5 sec

- Heat sealing pressure: 30-70 psi

- Heat sealing temperature: 135 °C - 190°C






Given its low surface resistance, LINQSTAT XVCF films have been successfully used as a pressure sensor making them useful for applications that require more conductivity to be able to detect more subtle pressure differences.


### Applications:



- ECG electrodes

- TENS electrodes

- Defibrillation electrodes

- Digital white boards

- Lithium ion / polymer battery

- Flat-cell MnO2 battery





Due to its low-resistivity and its resistance to a range of chemicals and alcohols, these films are suitable for use in electrodes. Their matte finish allows them to be printed on, and the low material thickness makes them flexible to adapt well to a range of contours.



### Chemical Susceptibility:



- Methanol: Resistant

- Ethanol: Resistant

- Isopropanol: Resistant

- Weak Acids: Resistant

- Ketones (Acetone): Slow Attack

- Weak Alkalines: Slow Attack

- Hydrocarbons: Non-Resistant




### Product Features & Benefits:



- Volume-conductive plastic

- Black Opaque - Printable

- Provides Anti-Static protection to electronics components

- Groundable

- Humidity independent conductivity

- Thin, Lightweight, Inert
