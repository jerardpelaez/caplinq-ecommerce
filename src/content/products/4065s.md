## Applications


**Battery & LED Technologies** 



TECHGuard 4065S is crucial in advanced battery technologies, especially for enhancing thermal management and safety in battery systems. One of its primary applications is in lithium-ion batteries (LiBs), where it serves as a coating for the battery separator, which lies between the cathode and anode. By coating the separator with TECHGuard 4065S, thermal shrinkage is significantly reduced, preventing potential short circuits that could compromise the battery’s safety. Additionally, the coating helps inhibit dendrite growth, which can adversely affect lithium-ion transport, further enhancing the battery's performance and longevity.


TECHGuard 4065S is also highly compatible with various coating processes. Its uniform particle size and spherical shape allow for easy dispersion into different matrices, forming stable suspensions essential for creating smooth, defect-free coatings. This makes it particularly advantageous for applications like LED phosphor coatings or protective layers in electronic devices, where surface consistency and uniformity are critical for optimal performance.


Note: Alumina coated battery separator prevent thermal shrinkage during high temperature operations.

What is the consequence of an unreliable battery separator?


With increases in battery energy density, voltage and packing size, battery materials become less and less electrochemically stable. It is reported that an unusually thin monolayer and an aggressive increase in battery energy, plus other manufacturing defects in the battery used in the Galaxy Note 7 resulted in a total product recall of their Galaxy Note 7 mobile phone.


Samsung’s investigation confirmed that the fires in the devices were caused by separate battery issues from two different suppliers. The third-party testing company, Underwriters Laboratories (UL), tested the batteries from 'Company A' and 'Company B', believed to be SDI and ATL, respectively. UL discovered that SDI batteries had internal short circuits caused by damage, while some undamaged batteries had deformed top right corners, and some negative electrodes were too long. For the ATL batteries, UL found that some lacked insulation tape, and in other cases, the insulation was damaged by protruding welds. These issues could lead to short circuits, overheating, and even explosions. After recalling phones with SDI batteries due to a design flaw that increased the risk of short circuits, Samsung replaced them with ATL batteries. However, manufacturing defects in the ATL batteries also caused explosions, leading to a second recall. This heavily damaged consumer trust and brand image, ultimately forcing Samsung to discontinue the production of the Note 7 to prevent further losses.










Thermal Interface Fillers High Purity Alumina (HPA) is an excellent filler for Thermal Interface Materials (TIMs) due to its superior thermal conductivity, dielectric properties, and chemical stability. The usual HPA grade used as fillers are the 3N grades as their particle size are suited for managing the heat pathways across the thermal interface. It enhances the heat dissipation capabilities of TIMs by improving thermal transfer between electronic components, reducing the risk of overheating. The fine particle size of HPA ensures that the TIM maintains a consistent bondline thickness and fills in micro-gaps effectively, resulting in better surface contact and improved heat conduction. Additionally, HPA’s resistance to high temperatures and chemical inertness make it ideal for use in demanding environments such as power electronics, LEDs, and high-performance computing systems. Its dielectric nature ensures that it doesn't interfere with electrical performance, making it an essential component in electronic cooling applications.




 


**Technical Ceramics**

**TECHGuard 4065S** is particularly well-suited for sintering processes used in the production of high-performance ceramics and components. Its spherical morphology and controlled particle size contribute to uniform packing density and low porosity in sintered products, leading to enhanced mechanical strength, thermal stability, and electrical insulation properties of the industrial ceramic.

One of the most significant applications of alumina in the ceramics industry is as a refractory material. Due to its high melting point, alumina is used as a **lining material in high-temperature furnaces and kilns **in applications where contaminants should be virtually non existent. Alumina also provides excellent thermal shock resistance, making it an ideal material for use in refractory applications. Alumina is also used as a grinding media in the ceramics industry. The hardness and wear resistance of alumina make it an ideal material for use in grinding applications. Alumina grinding media are used in ball mills, vibratory mills, and other types of **grinding equipment.**



**Aerospace**



TECHGuard 4120P is especially engineered for high-performance aerospace ceramics and components.


In aerospace and industrial ceramics, high purity alumina is often used as a refractory material, capable of withstanding extreme temperatures with minimal contamination. Its excellent thermal shock resistance makes it ideal for furnace linings, high-temperature tooling, and components exposed to rapid temperature changes. Additionally, alumina’s hardness and wear resistance make it suitable as grinding media in the preparation of ceramic powders, ensuring consistent particle size and quality in critical aerospace manufacturing processes.






 
**Medical**



TECHGuard 4120P is especially engineered for high-quality and biocompatible medical components.


Producing ultra-high-purity alumina for medical ceramics is uniquely demanding. Materials must be ultra-pure to avoid trace contaminants like Fe or Na that can cause inflammatory reactions or device failure. At the same time, they must offer high strength and wear resistance, with tight control of particle size and morphology to ensure dense, defect-free ceramics. Add the need for regulatory compliance—with full traceability and qualification to standards like ISO 13485—and it becomes clear: medical-grade ultra-high-purity alumina requires precision across purity, performance, and documentation
