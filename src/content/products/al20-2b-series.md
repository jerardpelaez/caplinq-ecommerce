shortDescription: AL20-2B is a colorless aliphatic amine liquid that contains branching, cyclic, and linear molecules. It is a premier epoxy curing agent that accelerates the curing process and can produce durable coatings in adhesives, composites, and coatings.This product is also used as a corrosion inhibitor that forms a protective coating to metals. Moreover, the product is also used as fuel additive enhancing the combustion efficiency while reducing emissions providing a sustainable solution. Triethylenetetramine, abbreviated TETA and trien and also called trientine (INN), is an organic compound with the formula [CH2NHCH2CH2NH2]2. This oily liquid is colorless but, like many amines, assumes a yellowish color due to impurities resulting from air-oxidation. It is soluble in polar solvents. The branched isomer tris(2-aminoethyl)amine and piperazine derivatives may also be present in commercial samples of TETA.[1]
