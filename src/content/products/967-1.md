shortDescription: LOCTITE ABLESTIK 967-1 die attach adhesive is is designed for applications which require lower-than-normal cure temperatures. It is ideal for application by automatic dispenser, screen printing, or hand probe. LOCTITE ABLESTIK 967-1 is an electrically conductive epoxy adhesive which reduces the risk to delicate components and increases manufacturing through-put with its quick, low temperature cure. LOCTITE ABLESTIK 967-1 has an average and maximum silver particle size of 8 µm and 25 µm respectively. 967-1 was developed as a direct replacement for H20S and it has replaced it for many customers including defense and aerospace applications (NASA outgassing approved when cured for 2hrs at 100C). Cure Schedule 6 hours @ 65°C 2 hours @ 80°C 30 minutes @ 120°C 15 minutes @ 150°C

### What is an acceptable viscosity change for die-attach dispensing?


Typically, we reckon that 25% change in viscosity is acceptable for die attach dispense processes. Based on this, 967-1 should be good for at least 8 hours (at 25°C). Please check the Technical documents section for more dispensing and pot life information.




LOCTITE ABLESTIK 967-1 TMA Curve LOCTITE ABLESTIK 967-1 DMTA Curve


The Tg and modulus will increase as the cure temperature is increased. Tg & modulus are determined mainly by the organic (resin) properties.


The CTE should not change much if the cure temperature is increased. The CTE is determined mainly by the filler & filler content.
