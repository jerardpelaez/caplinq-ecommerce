shortDescription: Hysol MG52F-99B NXP is a high productivity molding compound, designed for high volume encapsulation of surface mount devices. MG52F-99B NXP is applicable for devices having chip dimensions up to 1 centimeter (400 mils) square. Various versions are available including MG52F. MG52-99B NXP which is designed to provide much improved moisture performance after preconditioning. It can be applied using both conventional and automold equipment. MG52F-99B NXP was designed for and passed qualification testing on 28, 48 and 56 pin TSSOP packages and has been used in production for more than 20 years. These packages have a copper leadframe with palladium plating. This material is designed to achieve JEDEC Level 1 requirements at 260°C reflow temperature on copper based, palladium-plated leadframes. Hysol MG52F-99B NXP meets UL 94 V-0 Flammability at 1/8 inch (3.18mm) thickness. MG52F-99B NXP has high adhesion to a wide range of substrates including Nickel and Palladium, Low stress, fast cure and a large operating window, ideal for low wire sweep molding.
