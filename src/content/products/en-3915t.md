shortDescription: LOCTITE ECCOBOND EN 3915T is a thixotropic, black, heat-curable epoxy encapsulant specifically formulated for flip chip device applications. Its unique rheology ensures controlled material flow, allowing the encapsulant to remain exactly where it's dispensed. This minimizes liquid migration and prevents undesired spreading or displacement, leading to improved consistency and reliability in device performance. Designed for manufacturing environments that demand precision and speed, LOCTITE ECCOBOND EN 3915T features a fast cure profile—curing in just 7 minutes at 160 °C. It also offers a low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and a high glass transition temperature (Tg) of 130 °C, providing excellent thermal cycling stability. Furthermore, it is halogen-free, supporting compliance with global environmental standards. Product Key Features Specifically designed for flip chip device applications. Thixotropic formulation - ensures precise application onto substrate. Low CTE - minimizes stress due to thermal expansion.

Cure Schedule



- 7 minutes @ 160°C




Alternate Cure Schedule



- 10 minutes @ 150°C, or

- 20 minutes @ 130°C




Thawing



- Typical thaw times are listed as follows: 1.5 hours for 30 cc syringes 2 to 3 hours for 55 cc syringes

- Allow container to reach room temperature before use.

- After removing from the freezer, set the syringes to stand vertically while thawing.

- DO NOT re-freeze. Once thawed to 25°C, the adhesive should not be re-frozen.
