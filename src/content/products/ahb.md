### How to apply the Aculon HB






STEP 1 ⇨ CLEAN




STEP 2 ⇨ TREAT




STEP 3 ⇨ DRY










Parts must be sufficiently clean before treatment for proper bonding and effective application.


To clean, solvents or soap and water can be used to degrease the substrate.


Then, a cleaner is recommended to remove monolayer-scale contaminants.








Wipe - With the wipe, thoroughly apply pressure to the location where the hydrophilic properties are required




This product does not require a cure, however, in some cases and substrates a brief 5-minute cure at 60⁰C will benefit.






Dip - Fully immerse the part in the treatment solution for 1 minute, then remove the substrate.








### Application Tips



- If any bath will be subject to environmental contamination, recirculate the solution through a 0.2-micron polypropylene media filter.

- Dip tanks should be made of polypropylene or PTFE polymers.

- The product should be used at room temperature.

- Coat the substrate as soon as possible after cleaning to prevent recontamination.

- This material may be reapplied as needed.

- Dry temperatures and conditions should be optimized based on substrate and durability requirements.
