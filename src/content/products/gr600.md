## Designed for DPAK (TO252) & D2PAK (TO262) Power Discrete Packages



DPAK and D2PAK are power discrete semiconductor packages that are not easy to mold. The package geometry is not very difficult, but once molded, these devices need to be tested under BIAS before and after both humidity exposure and thermal cycling. This test is called the High Temperature Reverse Bias (HTRB) testing and is where most semiconductor epoxy mold compounds fail. Once biased, the device experience "gate leakage" and then fail catastrophically. Furthermore, most DPAK and D2PAK packages are often built using a Nickel (Ni) plating. Nickel is notoriously difficult to adhere to and as such make it difficult to pass high MSL performance levels. DPAK and D2PAK packages are still mature products and as such, the products used to mold them must be cost-competitive. The GR600 EMC is the first product in a series designed to meet all these criteria.
