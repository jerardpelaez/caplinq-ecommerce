shortDescription: "LOCTITE 3609 is a dark red, viscous epoxy gel designed for bonding surface mounted devices to printed circuit boards prior to wave soldering. It is particularly suitable for applications where medium to high dispense speeds, high dot profile, high wet strength and good electrical characteristics are required. Particularly suitable for applications where medium to high dispense speeds, high dot profile, high wet strength and good electrical characteristics are required. LOCTITE 3609 has been used successfully in lead free processes with water and alcohol based fluxes under conditions outlined in the Environmental Resistance section. It is designed for bonding surface mounted devices to printed circuit boards prior to wave soldering. This surface mount adhesive is used for small part bonding with a medium dispense speed of around 15,000-25,000 dots/h. Recommended Cure: 90-120 seconds @ 150 °C"
