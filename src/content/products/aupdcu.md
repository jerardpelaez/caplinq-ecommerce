shortDescription: "LINQALLOY AuPdCu Au Flash, Pd coated Copper wire is a winded，smooth surfaced, unpolluted bonding wire, ideal for wire bonding in IC semiconductor applications. It is available in thicknesses ranging from 18 to 25 microns and is fully compliant with the RoHS requirements of specific hazardous substance control. LINQALLOY AuPdCu bonding wires have been proven to provide better sulfidation corrosion resistance than the traditional alternatives while also improving Palladium segregation during the electric flame off process. Additionally they tend to stabilize the electrical resistivity of the bond while also requiring reduced starting voltage. Storage conditions: Gold flash Palladium coated Copper wires can be stored for 6 months in a vacuum sealed bag and need to be used in 50hours after exposure to ambient environment. Naturally, in a Nitrogen protected environment they have an elevated work life of 7 days. The vacuum sealed product needs to be stored in a stable and clean environment. The optimum storage temperature is ±25℃ with a relative humidity ranging from 30% to 70%. Once unsealed, put the product in a Nitrogen protected environment (up to 7 days). Otherwise, the recommended service life is 50 hours for ambient exposure ."
