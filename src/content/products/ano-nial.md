shortDescription: "LINQCELL ANO-NiAl is a nickel-based electrode with a binary nickel–aluminum alloy catalyst layer deposited through plasma spray coating. It exhibits low overpotential for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is the anodic half-reaction in both hydrogen generation and CO2 conversion systems. Traditionally, precious metals, such as iridium and ruthenium are used as OER catalysts. However, nickel-based materials, such as the LINQCELL ANO-NiAl, are emerging as strong alternatives to platinum-group metals due to their high reaction rates and long-term stability. The binary alloy composition further improves catalytic performance and oxidation resistance. Key Features: High Catalytic Activity for OER: The nickel-based electrode, with its binary nickel-aluminum alloy catalyst layer, exhibits low overpotential for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a crucial reaction in both hydrogen generation and CO2 conversion. Cost-Effective Alternative to Precious Metals: By utilizing nickel-based materials, ANO-NiAl significantly reduces the reliance on expensive precious, thus lowering capital expenditures. Improved Performance and Stability: The binary alloy composition of the catalyst layer enhances both the catalytic performance (high reaction rates) and the oxidation resistance of the anode, contributing to long-term stability and efficient operation. These feature make LINQCELL ANO-NiAl an ideal high-performance anode for both alkaline water electrolyzers and alkaline carbon dioxide electrolyzers. Highly Recommended for: Alkaline water electrolyzers, specifically as anode for hydrogen production. Carbon dioxide electrolyzers, particularly as anode for facilitating the oxygen evolution reaction. LINQCELL ANO-NiAl comes in different sizes and different woven mesh & perforated sheets substrates to meet various device design requirements. Contact us for custom sizes or other specific requirements."
