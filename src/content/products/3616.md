shortDescription: LOCTITE 3616 is a "chipbonder" designed for the bonding of surface mounted devices to printed circuit boards prior to wave soldering. Particularly suited to printing a range of dot heights with one stencil thickness and where high wet strength characteristics, and high print speeds are required. LOCTITE 3616 is a heat curable and stencil printable, red, viscous, surface mount adhesive that is commonly used to attach small parts and SMD components on PCB. Cure Schedule Recommended conditions for curing are exposure to heat above 100 °C (typically 90-120 seconds @ 150 °C). Rate of cure and final strength will depend on the residence time at the cure temperature.
