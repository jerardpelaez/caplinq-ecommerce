shortDescription: KESTER R562 is an organic acid, water-soluble solder paste specifically designed for resistance to environmental extremes. Water-soluble pastes tend to dry out in low relative humidity and slump at high relative humidity. R562 will maintain its print characteristics, tack and activity even after exposure to environmental extremes. Product Key Features Reduces BGA voiding 12-hour stencil life Print speeds up to 6 in/sec Consistent printing Applications Stencil printing & enclosed head printing (90% metal)

### Reflow Profile

The recommended reflow profile for R562 made with either the Sn63Pb37 or Sn62Pb36Ag02 is shown here. This profile is simply a guideline. Since R562 is a highly active solder paste, it can solder effectively over a wide range of profiles. Your optimal profile may be different from the one shown based on your oven, board and mix of defects. Please contact us if you need additional profiling advice.

Peak Temp: 219&ndash;230 &deg;C

Zones:

- Soaking Zone: 170&ndash;180 &deg;C, 60&ndash;90 sec typical

- Reflow Zone: 6&ndash;75 sec typical

Time to Peak Temperature: 3.5&ndash;6 min typical

Ramp-up: <1.5 &deg;C/sec
