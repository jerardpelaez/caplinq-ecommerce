shortDescription: "LINQBOND PM-PU514 is a user-friendly, two-component polyurethane system designed for electronic and filtration applications. It is formulated to have low viscosity, ensuring ease of processing. PM-PU514 is ideal for capacitor potting, PCB encapsulation, filter sealing (including HEPA), and cable jointing. LINQBOND PM-PU514 boasts a pot life of 25-30 minutes achieving full curing within 10-12 hours at 35°C. Its thermal conductivity >0.8 W/m·K, and wide temperature working range of -60 to +135°C make it a robust solution for various industrial applications. Additionally, with a UL 94 V-0 flammability rating guarantees strong performance and outstanding reliability.. Both Parts A & B are available in 250kg drums or 25kg plastic buckets. Contact us for more information. Key Benefits Low Viscosity: PM-PU514 offers low viscosity, ensuring easy application and thorough penetration into intricate components, enhancing the reliability of potting and sealing processes. Excellent Thermal Conductivity: With a thermal conductivity greater than 0.8 W/m·K, PM-PU514 effectively dissipates heat, protecting sensitive electronic components from thermal damage. Wide Temperature Range: The product's ability to perform in extreme temperatures, ranging from -60 to +135°C, makes it suitable for a variety of demanding environments, ensuring long-term stability and performance Key Applications Capacitor potting PCB potting Filter sealing/HEPA filter Cable jointing"
