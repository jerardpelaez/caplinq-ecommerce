shortDescription: LINQBOND SMA3611 is a one-component epoxy designed for chip bonding. This resin has medium viscosity and thixotropy. It cures at low temperatures and is suitable for screen printing and dispensing applications. The resin forms strong cured shapes without stringing or slumping, even at high-speed dispensing and with very small dots. The hardened surface does not exhibit surface oiliness. Once cured, LINQBOND SMA3611 offers good adhesive strength, electrical insulation properties, and excellent chemical and solvent resistance. Stable adhesive strength can be achieved with various SMT (Surface-Mount Technology) applications. This product is well-suited for electronic device encapsulation and chip bonding.
