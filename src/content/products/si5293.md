shortDescription: Loctite SI 5293 is a conformal coating designed to provide environmental protection for printed circuit boards and other sensitive electronic components. It is an alkoxy silicone that is fluorescent under UV light, and exposed to sufficient UV light irradiance to cure the material effectively. Loctite SI 5293 is a one-component material that doesn't require mixing. It is an encapsulant that can cure primary by UV exposure and secondary by moisture in shadowed areas. Advantages of Loctite SI 5293 PCB/Electronic component environmental protection One component - No mixing required Transparent amber to yellow liquid Excess material can be easily removed with non-polar solvents Functional strength is achieved almost instantly Cure Schedule 60 seconds @ 70mW/cm^2 (per side) Although functional strength is developed almost instantly due to the UV-curing nature of LOCTITE SI 5293, increased cure properties are developed during 72 hours at ambient conditions.
