shortDescription: LINQTAPE™ PIT1A-FRC is a clear high-temperature resistant polyimide film designed for both permanent and temporary bonding in many high temperature applications. It’s high breakdown voltage (4,000V) and high temperature resistance make it ideal for applications that require the balancing of multiple properties over a wide temperature range. The FR series has a special flame-retardant acrylic adhesive, which is rated for applications anywhere from –29 °C to 177 °C. Some applications include gold fingers for protection in wave soldering, ground barrier and phase insulation, and outer wrapping for small bobbin wound coils. LINQTAPE™ PIT1A-FRC film comes in 33 meter (36 yard) rolls of varying widths. LINQTAPE PIT-A polyimide films with acrylic adhesive are available in a range of thicknesses, starting from 0.5 mil (12.7 µm) thickness and up. Custom thicknesses are available upon request.
