shortDescription: LINQTAPE&trade; PIT1A-LO is an amber high-temperature resistant polyimide film designed for both permanent and temporary bonding in many high-temperature applications. These applications can be found in semiconductor, smartcard, electronic, automotive and aerospace industries. Its low outgassing properties make it a perfect solution for sensitive applications. It has a 1mil backing thickness and 1.5 mil acrylic adhesive. This tape has less than 1% TML and less than 0.1% CVCM values, making it suitable for aerospace applications. LINQTAPE&trade; PIT1A-LO has good adhesion and tensile strength and can operate in temperatures between -29&deg;C to 177&deg;C. It comes in 33 meter (36 yard) rolls of varying widths. LINQTAPE PIT1A polyimide films with acrylic adhesive are available in a range of thicknesses, starting from 0.5 mil (12.7&micro;m) thickness and up. Custom thicknesses are available upon request.
