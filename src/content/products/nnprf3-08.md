shortDescription: Nanoproof 3-08 is a highly effective electronic coating series designed to provide superior protection against moisture, chemicals, and corrosion for a wide range of electronic applications. With the discontinuation of the popular 3M Novec product line, the Aculon Nanoproof 3.0 series offers a readily available and accessible alternative for industries that require robust protection for their electronic devices. Nanoproof 3-08 with 8% Fluoroacrylate solids, forms a thin, transparent layer that provides excellent anti-wetting and anti-stiction properties, protecting electronic devices from harmful elements. With this amount of solids, it manages to reach a coating thickness of 0.25 - 4um. The coating also offers electrical insulation properties (3600V/mil Dielectric Strength), reducing the risk of electrical shorts and failures of PCBs and Electrical components. The Aculon Nanoproof 3.0 series comes in different grades, with Aculon Nanoproof 3-08 offering similar performance and chemical properties to the 3M Novec 1908 and 2708 products. It is ideal for use in harsh environments, making it a popular choice in industries such as automotive, aerospace, and defense. Aculon Nanoproof 3-08 is easy to apply, and its transparent coating ensures that it does not interfere with the aesthetics or functionality of electronic devices. It is suitable for use on a variety of electronic applications, including printed circuit boards, sensors, switches, and connectors.
