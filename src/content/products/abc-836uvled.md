Application tips

## How to Optimise for the Best Results

 

pcb preparation

PCBs must be completely dry and thoroughly clean, with no dust, grease, wax, or other contaminants. Coating adhesion depends directly on the quality of the substrate. All flux residues must be fully removed, as they can become corrosive and lead to circuit malfunctions.

How to clean the pcb

For cleaning equipment or removing uncured ABchimie836UV or UV LED varnish, we recommend using SND or ABclean solvent.

uv recommendation

It is essential to use the correct UV equipment (UV or LED) and follow the recommended settings to achieve the optimal properties of the cured conformal coating. These parameters influence both the coating&rsquo;s reactivity and surface quality. ABchimie836UV and UV LED cure through UV exposure, with moisture contributing to a secondary curing mechanism.

Curing Mechanism: UV light creates the first cure, and after 7 days the moisture from the environment completes the curing process.

double-curing mechanism

### How does Moisture Cure Work?

During UV curing, exposure to UV light activates the photoinitiators in the conformal coating, triggering rapid polymerization of the resin. This results in an immediate surface cure and fast development of handling strength. UV curing provides precise, on-demand curing in exposed areas, enabling high-throughput processing while maintaining coating uniformity. ABchimie836UV and ABchimie836UV LED use the same dual curing mechanism to ensure complete curing, including in shadowed or hard-to-reach areas. Initial curing is achieved by UV exposure, while a secondary moisture-activated cure completes the process at ambient temperature. For full curing in shaded areas, a minimum relative humidity of 50% is required for at least 7 days. Alternative to Mercury Lamp Curing of ABChimie 836 UV

ABChimie 836 UV LED is also available in the mercury lamp version, which cures with an mercury lamp.
