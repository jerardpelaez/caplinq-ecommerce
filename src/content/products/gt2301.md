Instructions for Use:





Before use, thaw the product to reach room temperature for 1–2 hours. Syringe should be placed vertically while thawing. Keep container airtight until room temperature is reached.




Ensure the surface to be bonded is clean and free of contaminants like dirt, grease, or mold release agents. A simple solvent wipe is often sufficient.




Cure time may vary based on the actual part geometry, material volume, and equipment. It is recommended to test on actual parts and equipment.




For large-scale applications, consider a staged curing process: start with a lower temperature precure, followed by a full cure at a higher temperature to effectively manage heat release.




The epoxy cannot be refrozen once exposed to room temperature.







Storage and Handling


Store and transport at a -5°C temperature. Keep away from moisture and heat sources. It is strictly forbidden to store in outdoor environments. Lower temperatures will ensure better flow and nullify any chance of cross-linking.







Shelf life at -5°C is 365 days.
