shortDescription: Hysol GR2820 is a black, ultra low stress, semiconductor-grade epoxy molding compound designed for the encapsulation and protection of thin walled conductive polymer tantalum solid capacitors (POSCAP). In the world of passive components, POSCAPs are relatively new to the scene. These solid electrolytic capacitors have many advantages, but offer challenges for epoxy mold compound manufacturers. After many years of development, the GR2820 has been developed to have excellent thin wall crack resistance - the greatest challenge of molding these devices. Furthermore, it has been optimized for automolding equipment. Hysol GR2820 is a silica filled(81%) environmentally "green" halogen free product, meaning it doesn't contain any bromine, antimony or phosphorus flame retardants. Previous MG-series EMC dominated the space for tantalum capacitors but used halogen-containing flame retardants. This material is designed to achieve JEDEC Level 1 requirements at 260°C reflow temperature on conductive polymer capacitors. It's fast cure time also ensures that it is compatible with the latest automold manufacturing equipment. Hysol GR2820 meets UL 94 V-0 Flammability at 1/4 inch (6.35mm) thickness.
