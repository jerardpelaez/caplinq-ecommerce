shortDescription: Hysol GR640HV-L1 is a black, heat-curable epoxy molding compound that delivers outstanding performance and ease of use. This material is designed to achieve JEDEC Level 1 requirements at 260°C reflow temperature. It is an improved version of GR640HV with better electrical performance version. Hysol GR 640HV-L1 is a "Green" low stress product with low cost of ownership that meets the strict MSL1 JEDEC requirements. It is designed for semiconductor discrete packages such as TO220, TO247 and other TO packages, SMA, SMB and other SMX packages and Transformers. It is developed for eutectic bonding and not for die attach bonding. In eutectic bonding, an intermediate metal layer that forms a eutectic composition with either or both of the bonded components is used. Eutectic bonding is a low-temperature process, which is beneficial for temperature-sensitive applications where high temperatures affect the integrity of the device components. It is important to check the compatibility of Hysol GR640HV-L1 with the bonding process to maximize its excellent moisture sensitivity capability. GR640HV-L1 meets UL 94 V-0 Flammability at ¼ inch thickness.
