### How to apply NanoProof 1.0






STEP 1 ⇨ CLEAN




STEP 2 ⇨ TREAT




STEP 3 ⇨ DRY






Parts must be **sufficiently clean** before treatment for proper bonding and effective application. This can be accomplished by first degreasing the surface with solvents/rinsing with IPA.


Dip - Fully submerge the substrate in a diluted bath of 1:4 ratio by volume of cleaner to DI water. After heating the cleaner to 40° - 50°C, submerge the parts for 5 minutes






To dry, blow dry the surface using an oil-free air source.










Wipe - Saturate an absorbent clean cloth with the solution and wipe the area with moderate force for 1-3 minutes. Then, rinse with DI water for at least 60 seconds and ensure the substrate is water break free.

### Application Tips





- For dip applications, dip containers should be stainless steel or glass.

- Clean all equipment with water.

- Coat the substrate as soon as possible after cleaning to prevent recontamination.
