  - High electrical conductivity
  - Works on Noble finished substrates
shortDescription: LOCTITE ABLESTIK 8370C adhesive is designed for automatic dispensing operations, where silver migration is a concern. In addition to being more resistant to electrochemical migration, it also has more stable reflectivity. Compared to silver filled adhesives that might get less reflective due to Sulphur in the atmosphere (or the adhesive), this material will retain its properties and won't potentially affect the performance of optical devices. LOCTITE ABLESTIK 8370C is a dispensable gold filled adhesive than can replace Silver filled alternatives when migration is not acceptable at all. It is compatible with Noble substrate finishes and should not be used in Sn terminations. Even though Silver migration is unlikely to happen in overmolded packages, there are certain applications that can be susceptible to it such as Automotive LED and that is where this high cost and high performance product shines.
