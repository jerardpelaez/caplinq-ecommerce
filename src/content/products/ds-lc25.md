shortDescription: "DOWFROST&trade; LC 25 is a ready-to-use, propylene glycol heat transfer fluid (HTF) formulated at a 25 vol% PG concentration (PG25). It contains a specialized corrosion-inhibitor package that slows oxidation commonly observed in glycol-based HTFs. The inhibitor package also stabilizes pH and reserves alkalinity, reducing corrosivity toward common system metals such as copper, brass, carbon steel, cast iron, and aluminum used in high-efficiency cooling systems. DOWFROST&trade; LC 25 is made with Dow PURAGUARD&trade; USP/EP grade propylene glycol (>99.8% purity), which meets strict United States Pharmacopeia (USP) and European Pharmacopoeia (EP) standards. Compared with lower-grade glycols, the lower impurity content of PURAGUARD&trade; PG reduces the formation of degradation byproducts that lead to odor, discoloration, and shortened fluid service life, effects that corrosion inhibitors alone cannot prevent. Key Features: 25% propylene glycol concentration (PG25) Made with Dow PURAGUARD&trade; USP/EP grade PG (>99.8% purity) Corrosion-inhibited glycol protects copper, brass, steel, cast iron, and aluminum Maintains pH stability and reserve alkalinity for longer fluid life Freeze protection to &ndash;10&deg;C (14&deg;F) Dyed fluorescent yellow-green for easy leak identification Formulated for high-efficiency heat transfer in industrial and data-center cooling loops The combination of high-purity propylene glycol and optimized corrosion inhibitors makes DOWFROST&trade; LC 25 a chemically stable, low-impurity heat transfer fluid suitable for long-term operation in industrial and data center cooling systems. Uses: Datacom and telecom equipment cooling loops Direct-to-chip liquid cooling for high-performance processors Data center thermal management and cooling systems"

Corrosion performance evaluated using ASTM D1384 testing at 190 &deg;F (88 &deg;C) for two weeks with constant air bubbling. Glycol solutions were prepared at 30 vol%. Corrosion rates are reported as mils penetration per year (mpy). Corrosion rates above 0.5 mpy (2.5 mpy for aluminum) generally indicate insufficient corrosion protection.

FAQ

## Frequently Asked Questions

▶ Is DOWFROST&trade; LC 25 compatible with elastomers and plastics used in liquid cooling systems?

DOWFROST&trade; LC 25 is formulated to maintain chemical compatibility with a wide range of elastomers and plastics commonly used in liquid cooling systems operating at bulk fluid temperatures up to 90 &deg;C (194 &deg;F).

Materials such as PTFE and FEP exhibit excellent compatibility at elevated temperatures, while EPDM, polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polysulfone-based polymers (PSU, PPSU) are generally suitable for operation up to approximately 75 &deg;C.

Some elastomers and plastics, including NBR, silicone, polyamide (PA), polyoxymethylene (POM), and certain fluoroelastomers (FKM), may have lower recommended temperature limits or reduced long-term stability when exposed to propylene glycol&ndash;based fluids.

▶ Can DOWFROST&trade; LC 25 heat transfer fluid be diluted?

DOWFROST&trade; LC 25 is a ready-to-use heat transfer fluid and should not be diluted. It is formulated with the correct concentration of corrosion inhibitors to protect datacom equipment cooling systems (DECS) and other liquid cooling loops.

If dilution is unavoidable, only purified water&mdash;distilled, deionized (DI), or reverse osmosis (RO)&mdash; should be used.

Minimum water quality limits for any unavoidable dilution:

Total Chlorides (as Cl⁻)
< 25 mg/L

Total Sulfates (as SO₄&sup2;⁻)
< 25 mg/L

Total Hardness (as CaCO₃)
< 50 mg/L

Total Iron (as Fe)
< 1 mg/L

Electrical Conductivity
< 50 &micro;mhos/cm

pH
5 < pH < 9

▶ Why does DOWFROST&trade; LC 25 have higher electrical conductivity than purified water, and is it a concern?

DOWFROST&trade; LC 25 contains corrosion inhibitors, pH buffers, and stabilizing additives that are intentionally added to protect metals and maintain long-term fluid performance. These additives increase ionic content, resulting in electrical conductivity values typically above 2,000 &micro;mhos/cm.

The higher conductivity is not a concern because DOWFROST&trade; LC 25 is used in closed-loop liquid cooling systems, where the fluid is fully contained and isolated from electronic circuits.
