shortDescription: LINQCELL CF400-MP is a 0.4mm thick carbon cloth with a Microporous layer and PTFE. It is commonly used as a gas diffusion layer and electrode for fuel cells. Its through-plane resistivity is less than 13 mΩcm2. LINQCELL CF400-MP is typically used in PEM fuel cells as well as PA and DM fuel cell applications as a gas diffusion layer. These thinner gas diffusion layers offer good electrochemical performance and can also lend themselves to AEMFC GDL Anodes. Thickness has more sensitivity to the AEMFC when used in the anode electrode rather than in the cathode electrode, indicating that water removal at the anode was more challenging than water supply at the cathode so the strategy of water management among electrodes should be differentiated. Carbon cloth based GDLs have performance equal to that of conventional carbon papers. Carbon cloth is more practical than carbon paper because of its superior compressibility, elasticity, and flexibility performance, making it more appropriate for ongoing manufacturing and assembly processes. Carbon cloths with a Microporous layer can achieve the required performance and provide an alternative option to carbon paper as GDL. Standard LINQCELL CF400-MP contains 10 wt% PTFE wet-proofing, and the PTFE content can be customized based on your specific requirements.
