shortDescription: Hysol MG15F-0140 is a black, semiconductor grade, anhydride curing epoxy molding compound designed for high voltage power applications requiring good electrical stability at high temperature. A real classic. The work horse, as the industry would call it, product of the halogen and anhydride containing chemistries. Hysol MG15F-0140 was typically used for power discretes and high voltage rectifiers. Despite its glorious history, the industry has been leaning towards next generation compounds that are future proof while still maintaining the same, or sometimes even better mold properties. GR 750 and the GR 750 XX series in general have nothing to envy and are good drop in candidates for the old guard. MG15F-0140 will be discontinued by end of this year since its flame retardant (Dechlorane Plus) will be banned by the Chinese government by 2024. MG15F-0140 will be replaced with MG15F-0140B.

This table summarizes and compares typical processing and cured-performance properties for two anhydride-cured epoxy molding compounds used in high-voltage power applications, showing that the molding window and cure conditions are broadly similar (gel time, spiral flow, transfer time, and cure schedules), while key material differences appear in thermo-mechanical and moisture-related behavior: MG15F-0140B reports lower Tg (195&deg;C vs 185&deg;C), lower CTE above Tg (70 vs 57 ppm/&deg;C), lower flexural modulus (13.7 vs 10.3 GPa), but higher molded shrinkage (0.2% vs 0.34%), while both grades meet UL-94 V-0 at 3 mm and show high volume resistivity at 500 V and 21&deg;C.
