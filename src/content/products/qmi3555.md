apiId: 4157
name: LOCTITE ABLESTIK QMI3555
slug: qmi3555
sku: QMI3555
brand: CAPLINQ
category: die-attach-pastes
subcategory: die-attach-pastes
sellingPoints:
  - Wide processing window
  - Silver/Vanagium glass
  - Reworkable at less than 350°C
shortDescription: LOCTITE ABLESTIK QMI3555 is formulated using a Polymodal Metal Flake distribution technology which utilizes a combination of specifically selected silver flakes that, in conjunction with a unique glass, maximizes adhesion to gold while simultaneously enhancing rheological properties of the paste. It is a No-Dry paste that possesses rheological properties which optimize dispensability during die attach and it is reworkable at less than 350°C. LOCTITE ABLESTIK QMI3555 incorporates a patented silver/vanadium glass at a metal to glass ratio of 6.5:1 by weight. The paste is completely resinless and fires into a film that provides high thermal and electrical conductivity as well as excellent initial adhesion. It is extremely resistant to degradation during temperature cycling from -65°C to + 150°C. A thin bondline combined with its excellent thermal properties make QMI3555 attractive for use in high power devices. Because of its wide processing range, one common low temperature firing profile can be used for both solder and glass sealed packages with nearly all die sizes. Compared to LOCTITE ABLESTIK QMI 3555R, the R in QMI 3555R stands for RESIN, so the QMI 3555R (resin) version contains ~0.1% by weight of resin added compared to QMI 3555 to slow down solvent drying. Technically both products have comparable properties after cure.

What is the difference between QMI3555 and QMI3555R? The R stands for RESIN, so the QMI 3555R (resin) version contains ~0.1% by weight of resin added over QMI3555 to slow down solvent drying. Technically both products have comparable properties after cure. QMI 3555 can be fired at temperatures between 300°C and 450°C on bare ceramic. On gold plated parts, the minimum peak should be 325°C. The minimum dwell time should at least be 14 minutes above 300ºC when the peak is Now – mix/degas the material in the syringe using "centrifuging equipment" as described below



- Thinky ARE-250 or ARE-310 mixer (available from Intertronics) or a “Speedmixer” from Synergy Devices would work well

- Vacuum versions of these mixers should be available, which will work better than non-vacuum versions, but may not be needed

- The process takes about 5 mins, but parameters should be optimized by DOE at the customers site




- Check the syringe, and push the piston down onto the surface of the 3555, if it lifted during the degassing

- The syringe is now ready to use and should be used within the same shift to prevent the settling of the silver in the syringe (or centrifuge again prior to use)




Such (vacuum) centrifuging equipment is commonly used in semiconductor back-end assembly.


tl;dr no QMI 3555 in syringes available, but process can be optimized using (vacuum) centrifuging equipment ….




### Why do I need a jar roller?


There are numerous options available on the market, including single jar and multiple jar rollers. The primary purpose of using a jar roller is to homogenize the silver/glass paste prior to use. As specified on the TDS: "upon receipt, the paste must be immediately placed on a jar roller and continuously rolled for a minimum of 16 hours before opening the jar".


There are no specific brands recommended, the most important is to achieve the homogeneity of the paste before its use.
