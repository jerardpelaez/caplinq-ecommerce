shortDescription: MCL C10 is a compression-grade melamine mold cleaning material designed for cleaning transfer molding equipment and epoxy molds. While more rigid than the rubber cleaning solutions it is able to go into the deepest corners of the mold removing hidden and hard to approach stains. This product is applied by manually laying an appropriate amount of product on top of the mold and applying heat and pressure (compression). A typical schedule is 2 - 5 minutes @ 150 - 190°C with 10tons clamping pressure for a good result. It is very easy and effective to handle so it requires only ~ 3 shots to clean all stains and residues for most cleaning processes. MCL-C10 can be supplied in loose powder if you want to pelletize yourself, in granular form and potentially in 5 x 5cm melamine cleaning pellets with a V groove break point to make it easier to break, lay down and apply on the mold. MCL-C10 has almost nonexistent amounts of Formaldehyde (0.02 - 0.07%). This proven formulation cleans very well without being toxic to the people involved in the process.

**Compression mold cleaning for transfer equipment? Is this a typo?**
 
Don't be confused with compression grade mixed up with transfer mold. Cleaning process and terminology is slightly different from molding. A compression cleaning compound is literally compressed on top of a transfer mold. It might sound confusing but that's industrial terminology for you.
