shortDescription: Honeywell's TGP1500 Thermal Gap Pads (TGP) are low cost materials, comparable to TGP1200 with better thermal performance and ease of use across a multitude of applications. Their ultra-high compressibility enables low stress and excellent conformity to mating surfaces. They are designed to minimize thermal resistance at interfaces, and maintain excellent performance through reliability testing. They have a very competitive cost of ownership and are ideal for not extremely demanding applications. Honeywell's TGP1500 is naturally tacky, and requires no additional adhesive which could inhibit thermal performance. Products have very low hardness and are available in a thickness range from 0.5mm to 5.0mm.
