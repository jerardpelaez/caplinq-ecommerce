shortDescription: MCL C12 is a compression grade rated melamine cleaning compound. Containing a relatively low amount of Formaldehyde, this white pelletized compound can clean by applying a varying amount of compression pressure and mold temperature making it flexible and easy to adjust to most molding processes. MCL C12 requires a couple of shots at 170 - 180°C with moderate pressure. It fits into various cleaning processes as an initial step right after the production shots and one step before rubber sheet cleaning. MCL C12 comes in white "biscuit" form that can be laid on top of the mold and easily covers the surface for manual compression cold cleaning processes. We name them tablets, you name them biscuits, you can also pass them as melamine cleaning sheets due to their sheer size but at the end of the day no matter the "package type" they clean well. And that's all that matters.
