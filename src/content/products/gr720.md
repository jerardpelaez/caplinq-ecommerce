shortDescription: Hysol GR720 is a green, halogen-free epoxy molding compound specifically developed for SOT (Small Outline Transistor) packages with stringent requirements. GR720 sets new standards for performance and reliability in the electronics manufacturing realm. With a strong focus on die attach paste bonded SOT, GR720 excels in minimizing stress during bonding, ensuring the longevity of sensitive semiconductor components. Its low-stress formulation is a vital attribute, enhancing the durability of electronic devices. Hysol GR720 its exceptional resistance to delamination, even after exposure to the rigorous conditions of MSL1 (Moisture Sensitivity Level 1) and TC1000 (Thermal Cycling at 1000 cycles). This outstanding performance guarantees the reliability of your devices, even when subjected to harsh environmental conditions. Moreover, Hysol GR720 offers exceptional workability, streamlining manufacturing operations and boosting overall efficiency. Previously, packages molded with Hysol GR720 was able to achieve a Moisture Sensitivity Level (MSL) rating of 3 for die attach paste bonding. Additionally, it boasts remarkable filler properties with a filler content and cut of 84±1% and 75 µm, providing the best possible moldability and as wide a molding latitude as possible. HYSOL GR720 also meets UL94 V-0 Flammability at 1/8 inch thickness.
