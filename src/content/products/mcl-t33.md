Directions for Use


Cleaning with melamine transfer compounds can be introduced in multiple steps of the cleaning process, depending on your molding process.



- Pre-heat the mold to standard operating temperature. Ensure that debris and other contaminants have already been removed.

- Add appropriate number of MCL-T33 pellets into the mold cavity. The amount of pellets added vary per mold size and level of contamination.

- Seal the mold and start a standard transfer molding cycle. The heat and pressure during the cycle activate the melamine cleaning compound, allowing EMC residues to be dislodged.

- Remove the melamine cleaning pellets and inspect the mold surface. If there are still residues on the surface, repeat the process or use CHEMLINQ Rubber Cleaning Sheets.
