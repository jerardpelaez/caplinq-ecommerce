### Product Applications


In sheet form (LINQTAPE PIT1S-ESD Series), the antistatic tapes are used to safely dissipate electrostatic charges before they can build up and cause harmful ESD events to critical electronic components.


These antistatic tapes also have a high dielectric strength which allows them to be used as electrical insulators and isolators. Further to this, these antistatic polyimide tapes have a low peel voltage feature which is important as they generate little voltage when they are unrolled – thereby protecting static-sensitive devices by minimizing the electrostatic charges added when the tape is applied.


This combination of properties makes them suitable for a range of applications including but not limited to batteries, smartphones, tablets, and any other application that requires an anti-static polyimide tape.


In disc form (LINQTAPE PIT1S-ESD-DCD Series), the precut shapes can be peeled right on the release liner and applied. CAPLINQ can also make custom-made stamped polyimide shapes that are stamped according to your specifications. Ask your representative for more information.


The silicone adhesive used makes it better suited to even higher temperature applications, but in the case that a silicone adhesive cannot be used, CAPLINQ offers also a version with an acrylic adhesive, PIT1A-ESD Series.


### Application Ideas
