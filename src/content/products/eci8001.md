shortDescription: LOCTITE ECI 8001 E&C is a Positive Temperature Coefficient (PTC) screen printable conductive ink designed for applications where self-regulating heaters are required. LOCTITE® ECI 8001 E&C is a screen printable ink formulated to rapidly heat to a specific threshold temperature and then maintain a constant temperature for the device. The self-regulating temperature of the bare ink is around 55 to 60ºC. It can be cured using hot air drying or infrared. It is ideal for use on PET substrates.

LOCTITE ECI 8001 E&C can be dried using forced air or infrared systems. Higher temperatures for longer time exposure will improve the performance. Care should be taken with infrared. Too much energy can destroy the coating. Design drying rates for the maximum the substrate and production speeds can tolerate.
