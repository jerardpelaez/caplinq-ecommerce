shortDescription: "LOCTITE 3705 UV cure adhesive is designed for high throughput assembly operations. Its thixotropic nature reduced migration of liquid product after application to substrate. LOCTITE 3705 cures fast and does not require any post curing steps. It is thixotropic with medium viscosity and exhibits good adhesion on a variety of substrates. This edgebonder is typically used to bond electronic components on a PCB. UV Cure: 80 seconds @ 30 mW/cm²"

UV/Light Cure Strengths



- One component

- No solvents

- Very fast room temperature cure

- Cure on demand-facilitates parts alignment

- Less equipment space and energy

- Fast through put-low WIP






UV/Light Cure Limitations



- Sensitive to light-requires special space lighting

- Oxygen inhibits cure

- Line of sight cure- shadowed areas require secondary cure

- High CTE- fillers used to lower CTE block UV/light
