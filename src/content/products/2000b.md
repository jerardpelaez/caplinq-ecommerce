shortDescription: LOCTITE® ABLESTIK 2000B electrically conductive die attach adhesive is designed for Pb-free PBGA and Array BGA packaging. This product is able to withstand the high reflow temperatures necessary for Pb-free solders @ 260°C. It is suitable for die sizes up to 12.7 x 12.7 mm. LOCTITE® ABLESTIK 2000B is a low stress, silver filled hybrid that cures fast with no voids and with minimal resin bleed. It is a die attach material with an ultra low moisture absorption. This is mostly used in Asian regions while LOCTITE ABLESTIK 2100A is the most common choice for the EMEA region. Cure Schedule 30 minute ramp to 175°C + 15 minutes @ 175°C

Loctite Ablestik 2100A is a product that is an almost direct alternative to Loctite Ablestik 2000B.


Loctite Ablestik 2000B is also a conductive die attach for laminates that it is mainly used in Asian regions. For EMEA we have successfully used 2100A as a drop in for use in BGA laminate applications with great success rates.


Ablestik 2100A DSC Curve - Heat flow vs temperature


Notice how the Onset of cure (minimum cure temperature) is about 70°C. Even though we suggest curing at 175°C, as with all products you can adjust the cure schedule (with a lot of trial, error and personal work) according to your final application properties.


The volume resistivity may be reduced when curing below 175°C (compared to the TDS value), but we expect that some conductivity will be developed.
