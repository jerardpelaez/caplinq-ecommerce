shortDescription: "MM-220 is a high-performance mono-functional acrylate monomer specifically engineered for advanced UV- and peroxide-cured resin systems. Featuring a unique polycyclic ring structure, MM-220 effectively minimizes volumetric shrinkage during polymerization, enhancing dimensional stability and mechanical integrity in cured systems. MM-220 has low viscosity ( ensuring excellent flow and compatibility in a wide range of formulations, making it an ideal reactive diluent for coatings, adhesives, inks, and composite resins. MM-220 also exhibits low weight loss at elevated temperatures ( and a high decomposition threshold (>400°C), delivering outstanding thermal stability for high-performance applications. Typical Applications: Reactive diluent for UV-curable coatings and inks Adhesives requiring high thermal resistance and low shrinkage Composite matrices in electronics and photonics Radiation-cured or thermally initiated systems (peroxide-cured resins)"
