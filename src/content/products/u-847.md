shortDescription: DMI U-847 is a high-purity, methacrylate-modified urethane monomer designed for use in advanced light-cure formulations, particularly within the dental industry. Its low color and low polymerization shrinkage properties make it especially suitable for aesthetic and precision applications where dimensional stability is critical. Unlike BisGMA or other Bisphenol A-based materials, DMI U-847 is engineered without a BPA backbone, eliminating the risk of estrogenic behavior or endocrine disruption. This makes it a safe and reliable choice for health-conscious formulations in dental, medical, and other regulated industries. Applications Light-cure dental adhesives, composites, and sealants Medical-grade formulations requiring BPA-free materials Base resin in photopolymer systems where low shrinkage and high clarity are essential
