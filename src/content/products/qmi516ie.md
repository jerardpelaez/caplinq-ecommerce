What is going on with Bismaleimide based materials and bleeding?


Bleeding is a known “side effect” of QMI products based on BisMaleImide (BMI) resin. The relatively low BMI resin viscosity allows higher filler loading and this makes this resin popular for semiconductor die attach use (next to its higher temperature and moisture resistance vs epoxies for instance). By using very fast “snap cure” profiles like most semiconductor companies do, bleeding can be controlled. Acrylate resin based products like CA 3556HF show less bleeding in general.


Bleeding can be also controlled by surface treatments, curing process and adding anti-bleed agents to the adhesives.


Sometimes if you take the relatively short pot life at 25C and high reactivity of QMI resins into account, next to its higher bleeding and higher resin cost base, we could suggest to focus on CA 3556HF and lower silver content ICP 8282 for specific applications. It is all application dependent and we are happy to help you choose.
