shortDescription: LOCTITE 3517M underfill is a heat curable epoxy, designed for use as a solder joint protection against mechanical stress in hand held electronic device applications. LOCTITE 3517M underfill is typically used for CSP (Chip Scale package), Flip chip BGA and Ball grid Array package applications. LOCTITE 3517M underfill contains no filler and is therefore suitable to be used in very low spaces. It contains hardener particle with an average size of 6µm and a maximum particle size around 30µm. Cure Schedule 5 minutes @ 120°C or 10 minutes @ 100°C For best results, substrate should be preheated (typically to 40°C for 20 seconds) to allow for fast capillary flow and facilitate leveling.
