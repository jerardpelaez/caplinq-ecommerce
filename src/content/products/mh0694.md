shortDescription: "High temperature resistant epoxy mold compound designed for encapsulation of automotive copper parts tested to AEC-Q200 specification MH20-2000 is a very tough epoxy mold compound with excellent high temperature resistance. It is designed for automotive applications that require thermoset epoxies instead of thermoplastics to meet higher performance requirements and AEC-Q200 specification. MH20-2000 is used on devices that have operating temperature above 200°C. It is CTE matched to copper, CuSn6 and bronze. MH20-2000 works equally well on tin-plated copper applications. Adhesion to these substrates has been tested extensively. Main Applications Thermal Fuses Tin-plated Copper parts Smaller parts designed to meet automotive requirements Product Features & Benefits: Very tough epoxy mold compound High Tg compound designed for higher temperature applications Used on devices with an operating temperature up to 200°C Designed for excellent adhesion and CTE-matched to copper, CuSn6 and bronze. Used on underhood automotive and other high temperature applications requiring a high glass transition temperature and great thermal cycle resistance from -55°C to 125°C."
