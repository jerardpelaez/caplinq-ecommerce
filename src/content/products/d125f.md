shortDescription: LOCTITE D 125 F is a one-component, heat-curable epoxy adhesive specifically formulated for high-speed dispensing in surface mount technology (SMT) assembly. With its low exotherm and minimal water absorption, LOCTITE D 125 F reduces thermal stress on components while ensuring strong adhesion and process reliability. This yellow adhesive exhibits excellent non-sag and non-stringing characteristics, enabling precise, clean application for chip capacitors, chip resistors, SOTs, SOICs, and PLCCs. It offers high hot strength and fast curing at low temperatures, making it well-suited for demanding, high-throughput electronic manufacturing. Applications Surface mount assembly of chip capacitors and resistors Bonding SOTs, SOICs, PLCCs, and other SMT components High-speed, precision dispensing processes Electronics production requiring low cure temperatures and non-sag adhesives
