shortDescription: LOCTITE ABLESTIK ICP 8118 is an electrically conductive adhesive designed for applications that require a very fast cure at low temperatures. It is ideally suited for high throughput photovoltaic dispense processes and applications where high adhesion strength is desired. Low and stable contact resistance is achieved on noble metallization during reliability testing. LOCTITE ABLESTIK ICP 8118 is a single component acrylate that displays excellent flexibility and is typically used for flexible interconnect in photovoltaic shingle applications. Snap Cure 10 to 15 seconds @ 150°C

Protip By applying a flat and thin 100-200um layer using JET dispensing or STENCIL printing (instead of one domed dot), we believe that the flow out and bleeding can be reduced by lower gravity forces.
