Instructions for Use





Ensure the mold surface is clean and free from dust, grease, or previous residues before application.




Release Agent Application: Shake the aerosol can thoroughly before use. Hold the can approximately 20–30 cm (8–12 inches) from the mold surface. Spray a thin, even coat over the entire mold surface. Avoid over-application to prevent an oily surface finish.




Molding Process: Allow the mold to dry, forming a barely visible, non-palpable film. Proceed with the molding process. CHEMLINQ MRE-S101 works at temperatures up to 200 °C.




Reapply as needed. For each molding cycle, apply a thin layer to maintain clean, dry, and easy part removal without sticking or tearing.




Post-Molding Care: After molding, if excessive build-up occurs over time, clean the mold as necessary to maintain optimal performance.







Storage and Handling


CHEMLINQ MRE-S101 silicone spray is supplied in aerosol cans and should be kept in a cool (10–25 °C), dry place (40–75% humidity) away from direct sunlight or temperature extremes. Once removed from packaging it should be protected against flammable environments and other impurities.
