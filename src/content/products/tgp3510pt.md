shortDescription: Honeywell TGP 3510PT is a green, thermally Conductive Putty Pad that provides high thermal performance and excellent thermal reliability. The material’s putty-like design enables excellent gap-filling capability for applications with large dimensional variances. Special surface reinforcement enables easier handling for operators during high volume assembly. It comes packaged with single (>=1mm) or double (Honeywell TGP 3510PT is naturally tacky and requires no additional adhesive to mate to heat source and heat sink. This product can improve production efficiency by replacing pre cured gels and is available in thicknesses ranging from 1.0mm to 5.0mm. Need a thickness below 1mm? Then we recommend our standard Thermal gap pads.

Fiberglass Layer Feature Since these are ultra-soft materials, handling during application presented certain challenges. To improve stability and ease of processing, a double layer of fiberglass reinforcement was added.

Shelf Life: 12 months at 23&plusmn;2˚C

Thickness range: 1.0-5.0mm with 0.25mm incremental

Thickness Tolerance: >=1mm, &plusmn;10%, 0.5-1mm, &plusmn;0.1mm What is the difference between TGP3500PT and TGP3510PT?

The key differences between these two grades are color and quality control.

- Color

- In the figure below you can see that TGP3510PT is green, meanwhile TGP3500PT is white.

- Quality control

- The hardness of both is exactly the same during the quality test. Specs for both grades are 6-20.

- The residual stress of TGP3500PT （@70% compression）is its QA item and it will be tested for each lot. This data is listed on COA as one of the quality items.

- Oil bleeding of TGP3500PT is tested every 5 lots. Test result is used as HON internal control but this is not listed in COA.
