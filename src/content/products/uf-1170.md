Thawing & Usage



- Thaw material at room temperature (14–34 °C) for 1–2 hours before use. Do not open the container until it reaches room temperature to avoid condensation.

- Keep the container upright during thawing; do not re-freeze.

- Use within 2 days after opening.

- Preheating the PCB to 70–80 °C can enhance flowability.
