  - Low cross-link density
shortDescription: BMI-5000 is an imide-extended bismaleimide oligomer that exhibits excellent toughness in the cured state with an intermediate cross-link density. It is soluble in aromatic solvents. This maleimide functional oligomer can be cured thermally, via UV irradiation, or in the presence of free-radical initiators to form a tough thermoset. It is soluble in most aromatic and aliphatic solvents such as toluene, nmp, etc. It can be processed in a resin system as a solid or dissolved in a solvent. BMI-5000 is recommended for use as an additive to increase flexibility, hydrophobicity and thixotropy. It has excellent adhesion to a variety of substrates. When used as a base resin, it can produce films that are tough, flexible and demonstrate good peel strength.
