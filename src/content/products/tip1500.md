shortDescription: Honeywell's TIP1500 thermal insulator pad is designed to provide low thermal impedance and high isolation for high power and high voltage applications. Integrated fiberglass reinforcement protects the pad from tears, cut-throughs and punctures.It is designed to be soft and conformal which provides excellent mating surface for low pressure mounting. TIP1500 comes in a pink color and offers 0.19mm and 0.23mm thickness. While the Breakdown voltage between TIP 1500 and TIP 3500 is identical and they are both V0 rated, their dielectric properties differ, mostly as an effect of the different thicknesses. Please consult the Specification fields and the Technical data sheets for additional information
