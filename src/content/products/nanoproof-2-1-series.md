shortDescription: NanoProof 2.1 is a surface treatment designed to impart hydrophobicity and reduced friction to circuit boards and electronic components. It is a simple, one-step process that provides a basic protective film for liquids. NanoProof 2.1 is a PFAS free, easy to use, and the dried film is nonconductive. The treatment can adhere to a broad range of substrates and contains a UV tracer. This product also requires no cure and can be applied through various methods including dispense and dip. Advantages of Aculon's NanoProof 2.1 More forgiving during application 30-50 μm thickness No cure required Deformable (gel like) coating so needs to be handled with care Contains UV tracer RoHS and REACH compliant PFAS Free Utilization of multiple options Please note that many customers have found significant success utilizing two or more of the available NanoProof® technologies successfully. Often times the most sensitive components benefit from the most robust NanoProof® technology (5.1) while the remaining components can be coated with the less robust coatings to benefit from their electrical push-through capability, flexible nature, and lower costs! Detection/Inspection All NanoProof products contain a UV Tracer which is visible under 365nm wavelength UV light (Detectable by both the human eye and automated detection systems). Please note that soldermasks and other substrate materials containing a UV tracer may make accurate detection of NanoProof difficult.

### How to apply NanoProof 2.1






STEP 1 ⇨ CLEAN




STEP 2 ⇨ TREAT




STEP 3 ⇨ DRY






Parts must be **sufficiently clean** before treatment for proper bonding and effective application. This can be accomplished by first degreasing the surface with solvents/rinsing with IPA.


Dip - Fully immerse the part in the treatment solution and withdraw at 1-5 mm/second (faster withdraw rate increases coating thickness).






To dry, the part should be placed at room temperature until the solvent is evaporated. Depending on thickness, parts should be fully cured in 60 minutes.










Dispense - Dispense the treatment over the surface, applying enough to coat the entire surface. Allow excess material to drain.










### Application Tips



- In some cases, Kyzen cleaners like Ionox I3s416 or Cybersolv 141-R may be appropriate for removing surface contamination.

- For dip applications, dip containers should be stainless steel, glass, or aluminum. Plastic containers are likely to contaminate the solution.

- Use a microfiber cloth to wipe after cleaning.

- Coat the substrate as soon as possible after cleaning to prevent recontamination.

- Cure temperatures and conditions should be optimized based on substrate and durability requirements.

- Expect no mask to be compatible

- Methylcyclohexane can be used as a diluent
