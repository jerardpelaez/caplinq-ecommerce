Processing Instructions



- Before use, allow TMC-688H to reach room temperature (20±5 °C, 40±15% RH) for a minimum of 24 hours for larger pellets and 12 hours for smaller ones, ensuring the bag remains unopened to prevent moisture contamination.

- For TMC-688H in larger sizes, preheating can be performed using standard RF equipment. Preheating must be done slowly to achieve uniform temperature.

- Apply an outer releasing agent, such as silicones or fluorinated compounds, to the mold surface to facilitate easy release from the mold dies.

- Prior to molding with TMC-688H or any new material, the mold should be cleaned thoroughly. To prepare the mold, the initial three shots should be cured for 5–10 minutes. After this initial preparation period, you can reduce the curing time to a level that provides sufficient hot hardness for effective release.




Storage and Handling


OPTOLINQ TMC-688H is available in pressed pellets in a wide range of sizes to meet specific customer needs. To ensure product integrity, keep it away from oxidizing materials. For long-term storage, maintain a cold environment, ideally at –10°C or lower. The shelf life under this condition is 6 months.
