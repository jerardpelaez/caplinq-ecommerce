## Product Description

LinQPlast PEEK-1000 is an unfilled polyether ether ketone (PEEK) engineering plastic that represents the gold standard for high-performance polymer applications. With a continuous use temperature of 260 °C, a tensile strength of 100 MPa, and a flexural modulus of 4.1 GPa, the PEEK-1000 combines the thermal and mechanical properties of a high-temperature material with the processability and weight savings of a thermoplastic. It is supplied as extruded rod, plate, and tube stock, ready for precision CNC machining into finished components.

PEEK-1000 exhibits outstanding chemical resistance, remaining inert to virtually all organic and inorganic chemicals, solvents, and fuels at elevated temperatures. Only concentrated sulfuric acid and some halogenated compounds at high temperature will attack it. Its low water absorption of 0.1% ensures dimensional stability in humid and aqueous environments, a critical advantage for precision components in medical, aerospace, and subsea applications.

Beyond its mechanical and chemical excellence, PEEK-1000 is inherently flame retardant (UL 94 V-0) with very low smoke and toxic gas emission, making it compliant with the strictest fire, smoke, and toxicity (FST) requirements for aircraft interior and mass transit applications. It is FDA compliant for food contact, biocompatible per ISO 10993, and suitable for repeated steam sterilization at 134 °C. CAPLINQ supplies PEEK-1000 in a comprehensive range of standard and custom dimensions to serve prototyping through production-volume requirements.

## Key Features

- 260 °C continuous use temperature for extreme thermal environments
- Tensile strength of 100 MPa with 30% elongation at break
- Chemically inert to virtually all solvents, fuels, and chemicals
- Ultra-low water absorption (0.1%) for dimensional stability
- Inherently flame retardant UL 94 V-0 with low smoke emission
- FDA food contact compliant and biocompatible (ISO 10993)
- Available as rod, plate, and tube in standard and custom sizes

## Applications

LinQPlast PEEK-1000 is machined into high-performance structural components for the aerospace industry, including bushings, bearings, seals, and backup rings for hydraulic and fuel systems. In oil and gas, it is used for downhole logging tool components, valve seats, and seals that must withstand high temperatures and aggressive chemicals. Medical applications include surgical instrument components, sterilizable housings, and implantable device supports where biocompatibility and repeated autoclave sterilization are required. In the automotive sector, PEEK-1000 replaces metal in transmission thrust washers, turbocharger bushings, and ABS sensor components where weight reduction and chemical resistance are valued.
