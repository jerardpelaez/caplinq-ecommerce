shortDescription: "Aculon EC nanoscale thickness (4nm) repellency product is a surface treatment that uses it’s hydrophobicity and oleophobicity characteristics to create epoxy repellent surfaces to control the location of epoxy used in semiconductor packaging. Applications include eliminating die attach epoxy bleed, reduce underfill epoxy keep-out areas around flipchip die, and eliminating EMC mold flash contamination. Added features include: wirebondable when used on a metal wirebond pad, repels: water, oil, flux, solder paste, and many solvents. In general use, it is designed to bond to most metals and certain polymers and resists chemical and mechanical degradation"
