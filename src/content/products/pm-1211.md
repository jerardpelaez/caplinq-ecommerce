Preliminary Instructions


Before using the potting material, make sure the potting surface is clean and free from oil and dust. Due to the higher proportion of component A, long-term storage can lead to stratification. Therefore, it’s essential to thoroughly mix it before use to maintain optimal product performance.




Processing Instructions





Mix component B to A according to specified ratio. Stir evenly while pouring the component and to ensure uniformity pay attention to scraping the wall until same color.




The product should be used within 1 hour from mixing.




Automatic mixer and filling machine can be used.







Precautions





For optimal results, ensure that component A is thoroughly mixed before use to prevent stratification during long-term storage. Additionally, apply the glue in a well-ventilated environment.




It is recommended to fully utilize the mixed component at one time. Any remaining glue and curing agent should be properly sealed and stored.




Generally, the potting thickness is less than 20mm. For deep potting, please contact us for technical support







Please note that the provided information is based on available data and typical conditions. For specific applications and detailed test results, refer to the actual test data and conduct appropriate certifications.




Storage and Handling


Store in a ventilated, dry, and clean environment 10-30 °C and 50% RH. At proper storage conditions, Part A and Part B has a shelf life of 6 months.
