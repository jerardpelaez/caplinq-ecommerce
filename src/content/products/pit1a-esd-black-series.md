shortDescription: LLINQTAPE PIT1A-ESD-Black Series is a high-temperature resistant, antistatic treated polyimide tape with electro-static discharge mounted with an acrylic adhesive. It is designed for both permanent and temporary bonding in many high-temperature applications. This tape has the same mechanical properties as our standard PIT1A-Series products but is black and has a 1µm conductive polymer that provides electro-static discharge and makes the tape anti-static. LINQTAPE PIT1A-ESD-Black Series tapes get their conductivity by being carbon-loaded. As such the film provides both thermal conductivity as well as antistatic control with a surface resistance of less than 10E9 ohms per square. This product is an alternative to Kapton XC film with an acrylic adhesive layer. We are moving on to discontinue this SKU and move on to a solution with a release liner. The price is almost the same. This will ensure better protection of the adhesive from pressure and from drying under nonstandard storage conditions.
