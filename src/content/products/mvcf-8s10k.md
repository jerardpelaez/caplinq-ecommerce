shortDescription: LINQSTAT MVCF-8S10K is a black, carbon-filled, electrically conductive polyethylene plastic film designed to provide both physical and static protection. Having a surface resistivity below 5 x 104 Ω/sq it offers medium-level static protection which means it effectively avoids accumulation of electric charge on itself and the products which it protects. Its easy-grounding nature makes it ideal for packaging where electrostatic contamination is a problem. Please keep in mind that 10,000 ohms/sq is not binding by any means. These are not meant to be highly controlled sheets as reflected on their price range. MVCF-8S10K is useful in applications where the key is to balance cost versus performance. As a medium-level conductive plastic, the carbon-loading is such that it is low-enough to be cost effective, while being high enough to meet the electrical requirements of military specifications MIL-PRF-81705D Type II and MIL-P-82646A. Please note that Linqstat MVCF-8S10K is only surface conductive and volume conductivity has not been tested and is expected to fluctuate . MVCF-8S10K PE film and its conductivity are unaffected by humidity and age. The film is heat sealable, flexible and offers exceptional abrasion resistance. The film gives good thermal stability and has outstanding chemical resistance. It is available in 8 mil (0.2mm). Other thicknesses can be available upon request. Additionally, the film has been proven to be highly UV resistant, absorbing UV radiation at 365 nm up to 100%.

In sheet form, the conductive polyethylene is used as a weak pressure sensor making it useful for applications that have large surface areas and expect large pressure applications. For more sensitive pressure sensor applications, CAPLINQ recommends LINQSTAT XVCF-Series, which is a more conductive series of polyethylene plastics.


As an antistatic packaging plastic, it is also used as an antistatic interleaver for Smartcard (micromodule) applications to separate subsequent layers of smartcard chips in micromodule production. It’s antistatic properties make the Linqstat MVCF series films also well suited for EMI and RF shielding applications.
