sellingPoints:
  - Great adhesion to several surfaces
  - Excellent chemical resistance
  - Higher operating temperature
shortDescription: LINQBOND T272 is a high viscosity permanent threadlocker that is suitable for applications with higher operating temperatures (-50℃ to 232℃). When cured, it has consistent high adhesion strength across different metal surfaces, including steel, aluminum, and plated metals. T272 exhibits great corrosion resistance and solvent resistance against common industrial solvents including water and non-polar solvents. Product Key Features Excellent adhesion and sealing properties 100% solids formulation High temperature resistance LINQBOND T272 has a fixture time of 30 minutes. Increasing the temperature or using AV-7649 will reduce its cure time.
