  - Fast cure for automold equipment
shortDescription: Hysol GR2710 is a gold semiconductor-grade epoxy molding compound designed for the encapsulation and protection of Conductive Polymer Capacitors and Aluminum Organic (AO) capacitors. Once molded and post-mold cured, this product provides optimum protection and reliability for these capacitor devices. Hysol GR2710 is designed for Polymer Conductive and Aluminum Organic Capacitors. These devices offer very high capacitance in a very small size. Epoxy molding compounds designed for these packages must have very low stress and very good thin wall crack resistance so that they can achieve the appropriate MSL performance, something that GR2710 promptly exhibits. Hysol GR2710 is a High Tg, environmentally "green" product, meaning that it doesn't contain any halogens including bromine, antimony or phosphorus flame retardants. This next generation epoxy mold compound replaces these older generation products. It is designed to achieve JEDEC Level 1 requirements at 260°C reflow temperature on Aluminum Organic (AO) capacitors as well as conductive polymer capacitors. Its fast cure time also ensures that it is compatible with the latest automold manufacturing equipment.
