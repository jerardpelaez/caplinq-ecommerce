shortDescription: "LINQSOL EMC-6043 is a green epoxy molding compound developed for the encapsulation of power discrete semiconductor packages, including small outline transistors and modules. It offers high spiral flow to meet stringent moldability requirements. EMC-6043 seamlessly integrates advanced material properties, safety compliance, and superior performance, precisely meeting the requirements of discrete power semiconductor applications. LINQSOL EMC-6043 is available in custom pellet dimensions. Contact us for more information. Product Key Features: High spiral flow (140 cm) — improves moldability of molding compound, allowing EMC-6043 to fill intricate shapes better. Low Moisture Absorption (0.25%) — improves long-term reliability in humid environments. High glass transition temperature (Tg =140℃) — ensures that the molding compound remains in a rigid state at elevated temperatures, preventing substantial deformation and stress on the chip. Applications: The coefficient of thermal expansion of LINQSOL EMC-6043 matches that of copper. It is compatible for encapsulation of copper wire coils. Also suitable for SOT, modules, and other power discrete semiconductor packages CAPLINQ also offers other semiconductor mold-related products such as rubber cleaning sheets, melamine cleaning compounds, and wax conditioning sheets.
