shortDescription: Hysol MG33F-0660 is the gold version of MG33F-0659. It is a semiconductor-grade epoxy molding compound or duroplast designed for the encapsulation and protection of tantalum capacitors. Because of its fast cure, it is also very well suited for the manufacture of tantalum capacitors and reed relays. Hysol MG33F-0660 was formulated with a short gel time to make it useful for automolding passive components such as tantalum capacitors and reed relays. It is an environmentally friendly, halogen free, "green" molding compound which contains no bromine, antimony or phosphorus flame retardant. MG33F-0660 molding compound was developed specifically for the encapsulation of tantalum capacitors in automold applications. MG33F-0660 meets UL 94 V-0 Flammability at 6.35mm thickness.
