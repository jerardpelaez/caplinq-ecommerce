shortDescription: "LINQSEAL GS-VMQ gaskets are made from silicone rubbers with flexible siloxane (Si–O–Si) backbones. Vinyl methyl silicone rubbers contain vinyl (−CH=CH2) in addition to methyl groups (–CH3) in the most common silicone rubber (polydimethylsiloxane). This structure offers good flexibility, resistance to water and chemicals, and sealing performance. LINQSEAL GS-VMQ possesses excellent resistance to extreme temperatures from –55 °C to 210 °C. It also exhibits low compression sets, meaning it maintains its shape and sealing properties over time, ensuring reliable performance throughout the operational life of the system. Custom LINQSEAL GS-VMQ gaskets can be tailored precisely to your specifications and drawings. The thickness ranges from 0.5 to 5.0 millimeters. The maximum dimensions are 1500 × 1500 mm2, while the minimum dimensions are 100 × 100 mm2. Key Features: Outstanding low temperature flexibility Excellent heat and oxidative stability High temperature stability (–50 °C to 210 °C) Low compression set Hydrophobic Highly Recommended As: Seals in food, pharmaceutical, medicine, and cosmetics manufacturing Flat gaskets for water electrolyzers and fuel cells"
