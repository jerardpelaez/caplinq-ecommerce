shortDescription: "***GR2821 has been completely superseded by GR2820*** Did you come looking for GR2821? This product is no longer available and has been completely superseded by GR2820. Wait, so 21 superseded by 20? Yes, naming conventions were not that bright back then. Hysol GR2821 was a black semiconductor-grade epoxy molding compound or duroplast designed for the encapsulation and protection of thin walled conductive polymer tantalum solid capacitors (POSCAP). Once molded and post-mold cured, this product provided optimum protection and reliability for these capacitor devices. It had been designed for Conductive Polymer Tantalum Solid Capacitors (POSCAP) In the world of passive components, POSCAPs were relatively new to the scene. These solid electrolytic capacitors have many advantages, but offer challenges for epoxy mold compound manufacturers. After many years of development, the GR2821 has been developed to have excellent thin wall crack resistance - the greatest challenge of molding these devices. Furthermore, it has been optimized for automolding equipment. Hysol GR2821 was an environmentally \"green\" product, meaning that didn't contain any bromine, antimony or phosphorus flame retardants. Previous MG-series EMC dominated the space for tantalum capacitors but used halogen-containing flame retardants. This next generation epoxy mold compound replaces these older generation products. This material was designed to achieve JEDEC Level 1 requirements at 260°C reflow temperature on conductive polymer capacitors. It's fast cure time also ensures that it is compatible with the latest automold manufacturing equipment. Hysol GR2821 meets UL 94 V-0 Flammability at 1/4 inch (6.35mm) thickness."
