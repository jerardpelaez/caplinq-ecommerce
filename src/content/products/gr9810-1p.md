shortDescription: Hysol GR9810-1P is a heat curable, state of the art, black, semiconductor epoxy molding compound developed to meet the stringent encapsulation requirements of package on package (POP and SCSP). It has been formulated to provide the best possible moldability and as wide a molding latitude as possible. It is a Green, halogen free product with, excellent dimensional stability, low shrinkage and High Tg. Hysol GR9810-1P and its related product GR9810-1PF offer a new technology platform on which Hysol develops epoxy mold compounds for high reliability sensors and modules such as humidity and temperature sensors. Key features of GR9810-1P are summarized as below. Reliability Improved adhesion promoter and toughening system High filler loading (>85%) for lower moisture uptake Reduced moisture uptake for best MSL performance Warpage Control Multifunctional resin hardener system with high Tg High cross-linking degree with special toughening system High filler loading for low CTE to minimize thermal mismatch High performance stress modifier to reduce internal stress Wire Sweep Control Optimized filler PSD with 75um (-1P) or 45um (-1PF) filler cut Low viscosity resin and latent catalyst for ultra long flow Hysol GR9810-1P is developed for advanced reliability control. The goal of this technology platform is to introduce an epoxy mold compound capable of passing MSL1 260°C on some devices and at least MSL3 260°C on a stacked CSP (PoP) devices.
