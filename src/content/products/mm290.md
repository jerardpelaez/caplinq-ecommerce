shortDescription: MM-290 is a liquid mono-functional acrylate monomer. It has similar properties as Isobornyl Acrylate (IBOA) when polymerized but with lower weight loss on cure. It has a mild, pleasant odor. MM-290 has good resistance to hydrolysis. MM-290 is recommended for use in UV or peroxide cure formulations. It is particularly recommended for applications that require hydrolytic resistance. This monomer has a much, much, much better smell than isobornyl acrylates and has a significantly lower weight loss.
