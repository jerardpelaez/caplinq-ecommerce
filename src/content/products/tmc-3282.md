Processing Instructions





Before use, allow TMC-3282 to reach room temperature (20±5 °C, 40±15% RH) for a minimum of 24 hours, ensuring the bag remains unopened to prevent moisture contamination.




For TMC-3282, preheating can be performed using standard RF equipment. Preheating must be done slowly to achieve uniform temperature.




Apply an outer releasing agent, such as silicones or fluorinated compounds, to the mold surface to facilitate easy release from the mold dies. Different curing conditions should be used depending on the mold design package, kind, and device type.




Prior to molding with TMC-3282 or any new material, the mold should be cleaned thoroughly. To prepare the mold, the initial three shots should be cured for 5–10 minutes. After this initial preparation period, you can reduce the curing time to a level that provides sufficient hot hardness for effective release.







Please note that the provided information is based on available data and typical conditions. For specific applications and detailed test results, refer to the actual test data and conduct appropriate certifications.




Storage and Handling


OPTOLINQ TMC-3282 is available in pressed pellets in a wide range of sizes to meet specific customer needs. To ensure product integrity, keep it away from oxidizing materials. For long-term storage, maintain a cold environment, ideally at –10°C or lower. The shelf life under this condition is 6 months.
