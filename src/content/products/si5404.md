slug: si5404
sku: SI5404
brand: CAPLINQ
category: non-conductive-adhesives
subcategory: non-conductive-adhesives
sellingPoints:
  - Electrical isolation
  - Thermally conductive
  - Bond metallic heat sinks
shortDescription: LOCTITE SI 5404 is designed to bond metallic heat sinks, ceramic chips and circuit board substrates. LOCTITE SI 5404 applications include the bonding of various heat generating devices (power devices) to their respective heat sinks. LOCTITE SI 5404 is designed to provide a strong bond between the device and its heat sink as well as low resistance to the flow of heat from the electronic device to the heat sink. A typical application would be the bonding of any power semiconductor, module, graphics processor or other heat generating device to a heat sink or metal enclosure in an electronics circuit. LOCTITE SI 5404 is a "heavy paste" type of substance and that’s why extrusion rate is mentioned on TDS, instead of viscosity. This is a measurement of a certain amount per minute which will be squeezed out of the cartridge after applying pressure. If you need TC higher than 1 W/mK you might be interested in SI5406M RTV silicone with 1.5 W/mK. Cure Schedule 10 minutes for 150°C 15 minutes for 130°C IR or Convection oven

### 


### We are dealing with multiple materials in our lab. How should we approach Silicones? Any standards or methods?


We are not aware of any standards that deal with the compatibility of silicones and other adhesives. It is clear that silicones are bad for adhesion for non-silicone materials so you should try to avoid cross-contamination. We would keep these separate or apply silicone as the last step, if possible.




Regarding Pot life, this heat-curing silicone material is stable for days at temperatures below 30°C. We do not have specific test data on this.
