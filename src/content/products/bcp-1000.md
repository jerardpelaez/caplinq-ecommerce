shortDescription: "LINQSOL BCP-1000 is a blue, busbar epoxy coating powder. This halogen free material offers good adhesion, good heat and moisture resistance, and good electrical insulation properties. It is widely applied in various low voltage busbar applications ( as an insulation and moisture-proof protective layer. LINQSOL BCP-1000 exhibits excellent resistance to heat vibration and mechanical shock. Its excellent adhesion to copper, allows it to eliminate the air gap between busbar and insulation layer and to avoid potential safety hazards. This coating powder's excellent thermal conductivity, can transfer away the heat released by the busbar in time, and increase the service life of the busbar. Finally it is environmentally friendly with flame retardant properties and complies with RoHS directive requirements. This busbar insulation epoxy powder allows high production efficiency thanks to its fast curing characteristics. It is strongly recommend for electrostatic spraying (60-80KV) coating. It owns the best cost-performance ratio. Recommended Curing Temperature: 200 °C x 15 min"

### Storage


Store in a ventilated, dry, and clean environment below 25°C. Keep away from fire and heat sources. It is strictly forbidden to store in outdoor environments. At proper storage conditions, the product has a shelf life of 6 months.


### Precautions



- Avoid long-term skin contact. Powder that touched the skin should be rinsed off quickly.

- During operation dust-proof masks should be used to avoid inhalation.

- Keep the oven temperature stable, so as not to affect the colour and quality of the coating due to excessive temperature deviation.

- The concentration of dust should be controlled within a safe range to avoid malfunction of the coating equipment.
