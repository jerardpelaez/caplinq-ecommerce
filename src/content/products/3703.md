shortDescription: LOCTITE® 3703 is an acrylic adhesive paste, primarily designed for bonding rigid and flexible PVC to polycarbonate where large gap filling capabilities (0.25mm) and a flexible joint are desired. Its flexibility enhances the load bearing and shock absorbing characteristics of the bond area. The product has shown excellent adhesion to a wide variety of substrates including glass, many plastics and most metals. The thixotropic nature of LOCTITE® 3703 reduces the migration of liquid product after application to the substrate and is ideal for optical applications. LOCTITE® 3703 is an acrylated urethane white/translucent paste that can be cured by exposure to UV and/or visible light of sufficient intensity. Surface cure is enhanced by exposure to UV light in the 220 to 260 nm range. Cure rate and ultimate depth of cure depend on light intensity, spectral distribution of the light source, exposure time and light transmittance of the substrate through which the light must pass. This product has been removed from our product list, but fret not. LOCTITE DSP 190024 is an almost identical UV cure display sealant product in larger package sizes, suitable for the display market.

LOCTITE® 3703™ can be cured by exposure to UV and/or visible light of sufficient intensity. Surface cure is enhanced by exposure to UV light in the 220 to 260 nm range. Cure rate and ultimate depth of cure depend on light intensity, spectral distribution of the light source, exposure time and light transmittance of the substrate through which the light must pass. Fixture Time UV fixture time is defined as the light exposure time required to develop a shear strength of 0.1 N/mm².
