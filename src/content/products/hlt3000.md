shortDescription: Honeywell HLT3000 is a two-part, dispensable thermal gap filler with low viscosity and good thixotropy properties that allows it to be stencil printable. This gap filler is silicone based and is easy to dispense and print after 1:1 mixing. It can be a great replacement for thermal grease if you're facing pump out issues and it can offer all the benefits and reliability of gel materials in a printable form, without having to invest in dispensing equipment. Honeywell HLT3000 passes the rigorous automotive vibration testing without oil bleeding and is formulated to balance thermal performance, phase separation and long term reliability. Additionally it has no moisture absorption at all, post D85 testing. With its high compressibility, it is designed to minimize thermal resistance at interfaces and suitable for thin bond line applications. The material is available in 200+200cc syringes, 1+1 gallon and 5+5 gallon jars The product can be cured either for 18 hours at Room temperature or 20minutes at 120°C. Of course those are just indications and you can experiment with curing for your application needs.
