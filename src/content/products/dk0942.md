shortDescription: "DK15EG-05 Black is an epoxy based coating powder developed for the insulation of motor armatures and stators. It offers cut-through temperature resistance and is flex-fuel (unleaded gasoline and methanol) resistant. DK15EG-05 Black is designed to be applied by an electrostatic fluid bed process, offering a fast cure in an induction coil curing process. Particle size is tailored to provide low dusting levels. DK15EG-05 is flex-fuel (gasohol, gasoline/ethanol blend) resistant, Class F-rated epoxy powder coating for slot insulation of automotive fuel pump motor armatures and stators. It works extremely well for both AC and DC electric motors, including those used for in-tank fuel pumps. The coating provides superior flex fuel resistance, edge coverage, and high impact strength. High cut through temperature serves to protect the motor even at high operating temperatures. DK15EG-05 is designed for electrostatic fluid bed application, and DK15EG-05 is tested and qualified for UL EIS 1446 155°C (Class F) rating. DK15EG-05 is available in both black and green color. It is black in color, though DK15EG-05 Green is the green color version of DK15EG-05 Black. Both versions have been used for over 20 years by major manufacturers of automotive enclosures, fuel pumps, windshield wipers, seat adjusters, and other, DK15EG-05 provides a smooth surface appearance with high edge coverage. Particle size is optimized for high productivity on an electrostatic fluidized bed coating process including Braun Sondermaschinen. Advantages of DK15EG-05 for Slot Insulation Flex-fuel resistant, suitable for exposure to automotive fluids A high pickup powder, it provides high productivity on Braun Sondermaschinen and other electrostatic fluidized bed machines Permits the use of more copper in the slots allowing for smaller, higher-power motors Reduced copper waste compared to slot liners since the winding does not need to go up and over the liner Excellent moisture resistance, even in high temperatures and corrosive conditions A high-productivity coating powder, used for decades in the manufacture of fuel pump assemblies Typical applications and uses of DK15EG-05 Black or Green include: Slot Insulation of AC and DC Motor Armatures Slot Insulation of Stators Slot Insulation of Motor Armatures in Fuel Pump Motors It has also been tested successfully for hairpin coating of 400V electric motors This product is no longer available. Some alternatives for armature and stator coating powders are: MCP-5260 Class F Motor Coating Powder MCP-5000 Class B Motor Coating Powder"
