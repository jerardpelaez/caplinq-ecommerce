shortDescription: LOCTITE LF 318 solder paste is a halide-free, no clean, pin testable Pb-free solder paste, formulated to have excellent humidity resistance and a broad process window, both for reflow and printing. This product has high tack force to resist component movement during high speed placement and long printer abandon times. LOCTITE LF 318 shows excellent solderability over a wide range of reflow profiles in both air and nitrogen across a wide range of surface finishes including Ni/Au, Immersion Sn, Immersion Ag, OSP copper. It leaves colorless and soft, non stick residues for easy post reflow inspection and in-circuit testing. LOCTITE LF 318 should not be used to solder to component or PCB finishes containing lead (Pb), as a low melting eutectic (at 98°C) will form. It is suitable for fine pitch, high speed printing and pneumatic dispensing. LOCTITE LF 318 contains a modified Pb-free solder alloy developed in a co-operative project for improved reliability as compared with standard SAC alloys, with a standard flux medium , LF 318.
