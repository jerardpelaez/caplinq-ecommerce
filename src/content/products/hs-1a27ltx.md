## Learn More About HumiSeal&reg; 1A27 LTX

Application Methods

HumiSeal&reg; 1A27 LTX is designed for flexible application across automated and manual coating processes.

Application Methods:

- Dipping: Viscosity may be adjusted using HumiSeal&reg; Thinner 789 to ensure uniform film thickness. Controlled immersion and withdrawal rates of 5&ndash;15 cm/min are recommended. Viscosity should be monitored regularly using Zahn or Ford cups.

- Spraying: Suitable for conventional spray equipment. Thinning with HumiSeal&reg; Thinner 789 is required to achieve a uniform, pinhole-free coating. Adequate ventilation must be provided.

- Brushing: Can be applied by brush with minor thinning. Final film quality depends on component density and operator technique.

Important Notes:

- Substrates must be clean, dry, and free of flux, grease, and contaminants.

- Contamination beneath the coating can lead to electrical or mechanical failure.

- Allow sufficient curing time to reach optimum performance.

Application Compatibility

HumiSeal&reg; 1A27 LTX is compatible with a wide range of PCB materials and electronic components.

Compatible With: ✔ Printed circuit boards and electronic assemblies ✔ Automated dip, spray, and selective coating systems ✔ Standard electronics manufacturing materials

Additional Guidance: For optimal performance, ensure proper cleaning prior to coating. Consult Technical Support for guidance on viscosity adjustment, equipment selection, or pre-blend solutions.

### Safety and Handling Precautions ⚠️

- Use only in well-ventilated areas.

- Avoid inhalation of vapors or spray mist.

- Avoid contact with skin and eyes.

- Keep away from sparks, hot surfaces, and open flames.

- Follow all local and national health and safety regulations.

Always consult the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) before use.

### Storage Recommendations 📦

Store HumiSeal&reg; 1A27 LTX in tightly closed containers, away from excessive heat or cold. Recommended storage temperature is 0&ndash;35&deg;C. Prior to use, allow the material to equilibrate for 24 hours at room temperature (18&ndash;32&deg;C).

### Compliance You Can Trust ✅

HumiSeal&reg; 1A27 LTX meets stringent regulatory and performance standards for conformal coatings:

✔ GB30981-2020 compliant ✔ UL 94 V-0 flammability rated ✔ High dielectric strength and insulation resistance ✔ Designed for long-term electronic protection
