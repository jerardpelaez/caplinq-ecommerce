  - Stable thermal performance during Aging test
shortDescription: BS-2000 is a high-performance, silicone-free, dual-component gap filler specifically designed for efficient thermal management in electronics and automotive applications. BS-2000 is ideal for filling and leveling gaps between heat-generating components and cooling plates, ensuring optimal heat dissipation and enhancing the longevity and reliability of your devices. BS-2000 features SMP (Silyl Modified Polymer) chemistry, which significantly enhances adhesion throughout its entire service life. Unlike silicones or polyurethanes (PUs), the thermal resistance of this material improves over time, allowing for the use of lower initial thermal conductivity values without compromising long-term performance. This ensures consistent and reliable thermal management, making it an ideal choice for reliability demanding applications.

- Simple processing using dispensing equipment customized cartridges.

- Ease of automation process

- Processing at elevated temperature (60 ℃) decreases viscosity which enables excellent dispensing properties

- The material can be removed in a non-crosslinked state by simple wiping, and with commercially available solvent/cleaners

- Crosslinking occurs 24h after mixing.
