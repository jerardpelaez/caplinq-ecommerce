## Product Description

LinQBond EP-200 is a two-component structural epoxy adhesive engineered for high-strength bonding in electronics, automotive, and aerospace applications. Combining exceptional mechanical strength with outstanding chemical and thermal resistance, the EP-200 creates durable bonds between metals, ceramics, glass, and engineering plastics. With a lap shear strength of 25 MPa on aluminum, it delivers structural integrity that meets the demands of load-bearing assemblies and safety-critical joints.

The EP-200 features a convenient 100:30 mix ratio and a 90-minute pot life at 25 °C, providing ample working time for complex assembly operations. It cures at room temperature within 24 hours or can be accelerated with heat -- a 60-minute cure at 80 °C or a 30-minute cure at 120 °C produces full mechanical properties. The cured adhesive exhibits a Shore D hardness of 85 and a glass transition temperature of 120 °C, maintaining rigidity and bond strength across an operating range of -55 to 180 °C.

Formulated with a carbon-black-filled epoxy matrix, the EP-200 resists a wide range of chemicals including fuels, oils, hydraulic fluids, and common solvents. It also provides excellent moisture resistance, making it suitable for outdoor and harsh-environment applications. The EP-200 is qualified for use under multiple automotive OEM specifications and is available in dual-cartridge systems with static mixing nozzles for clean, consistent dispensing.

## Key Features

- 25 MPa lap shear strength on aluminum substrates
- 90-minute pot life for flexible assembly operations
- Room temperature or heat-accelerated cure options
- Operating range: -55 to 180 °C
- Outstanding chemical and solvent resistance

## Applications

LinQBond EP-200 is used for structural bonding of heat sinks to power modules, attachment of electronic housings and enclosures, and bonding of sensors and connectors in automotive under-hood environments. In aerospace, it is used for bonding composite panels, attaching brackets, and assembling avionics enclosures where weight savings from adhesive bonding over mechanical fasteners are valued. The EP-200 is also widely used in industrial electronics for mounting transformers, securing PCBs, and bonding magnets in electric motor assemblies.
