shortDescription: LOCTITE ECCOBOND FIL 7010C is a low viscosity, one component, SVHC free, epoxy product designed for use as a potting or encapsulation resin protection for stress sensitive electronic components. It is specially formulated with a low thermal expansion and high Tg, along with a toughened polymer backbone making it ideally suited to survive severe thermal shock conditions with a high resistance to micro cracking. LOCTITE ECCOBOND FIL 7010C is a REACH compliant product, designed to survive constant service temperatures of 150°C, with peak temperatures of up to 180°C for chip on board encapsulation. Cure Schedule 2 hours @ 140°C 1 hour @ 100°C plus 1 hour @ 150°C (Low Stress)

### Why is FIL7010C considered a "Green" product compared to FP4470?


As you can imagine, the formulations of FP4470 and FIL7010C are different. FP4470 contains a substance of very high concern "Hexahydromethylphthalic anhydride" (CAS no. 25550-51-0) which is used as an epoxy hardener. The SVHC list is determined based on the dangers and concerns on an individual substance/molecule basis.


Hexahydromethylphthalic anhydride (CAS no. 25550-51-0)


The FIL7010C formulation does NOT currently contain any substances on the SVHC list and that is why it is considered a less harmful formulation. For the Chemistry enthusiasts, the epoxy hardener part in the FIL7010C formulation is similar, but still completely different.




Methyltetrahydrophthalic anhydride (CAS No. 11070-44-3).




### Directions for use



- Cure the product per the cure schedule mentioned in the Typical Cure Schedule section of the document.

- The surfaces on which the adhesive has to be applied should be clean, dry and free from all dust.

- Initially dispense LOCTITE ECCOBOND FIL 7010C on the outline of the glob referred to as the "dam".

- The dam is then filled in with LOCTITE ECCOBOND FIL 7010C material.

- Both materials can be co-cured after dispense.






For the low stress schedule we need to point out that according to the DSC curve the cure reaction barely starts at 100-125C. Yes, it happens and yes it is a low stress alternative but given the oven temperature tolerances, batch to batch variations etc we always run the risk of inconsistent results. You should always develop a process that works for your application but for repeatable and predictable results we recommend curing at least at 140°C.


Alternative schedules that could reduce warpage are:



- Gelling temp to 150C and run basically straight 2 hours 150C, and or

- Gelling temp to 150C for 30min followed by 1.5 hours at 160C, and or

- Simply run a straight 2 hours 160C
