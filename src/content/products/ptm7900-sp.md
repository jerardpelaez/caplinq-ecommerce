shortDescription: PTM7900-SP is a viscous, stencil printable version of PTM7900 with identical properties. It is designed to minimize thermal resistance at interfaces and maintain extremely stable performance through reliability testing required for long product life applications. It has stable Thermal Impedance across accelerated aging tests and does not display bleed, pump or flow out. PTM7XXX product line has the highest Thermal conductivity and lowest thermal impedance out of the entire PTM Series PTM7900-SP has a Thermal conductivity of 8.0 (W/m·K) depending on the bondline thickness and is based on a robust polymer PCM structure that exhibits excellent wetting properties during typical operating temperature ranges, resulting in very low surface contact resistance. This proprietary material provides superior reliability and maintains low thermal impedance (0.045) , making it desirable for high-performance integrated circuit devices. It has been qualified from major GPU and cooling solution manufacturers across the globe. PTM7900-SP is almost as good as it gets. The only product that has slightly better thermal properties is PTM7950 which reaches 8.5 W/m·K and 0.04 TI and is designed for extremely demanding and tight applications. Drying time 24 hours at Room temperature Under 5 mins at 100°C PTM7900 and PTM7950 are closely related thermal interface materials with slight differences in performance. PTM7950 features a softer composition, higher thermal conductivity, and lower thermal impedance, enhancing its overall thermal performance. Aside from these improvements, both materials share similar characteristics.

When choosing a printable paste it is important to understand the process parameters and limitations.


That's why we ask, when you contact us, to include the following information:



- What is your print thickness?

- How long is your printing time and working window?

What is your drying step after printing?


- Temperature (Room temperature or something else?)

- Time




- Do you have any viscosity limitations in the printing process?
