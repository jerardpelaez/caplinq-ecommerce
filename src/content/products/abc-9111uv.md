## Frequently Asked Questions About ABChimie&reg; 9111 UV

### What are typical applications for ABChimie&reg; 9111 UV?

ABChimie&reg; 9111 UV is a UV-curable glue designed for the bonding and protection of printed circuit board assemblies (PCBs) and electronic components in demanding manufacturing environments, including:

Automotive electronics (e.g., control units, sensors)

Industrial automation (e.g., motor drives, PLCs)

Consumer electronics (e.g., smart devices, wearables)

Other high-reliability electronic assemblies

### Why choose ABChimie&reg; 9111 UV?

ABChimie&reg; 9111 UV delivers rapid UV curing, excellent electrical insulation, is colorless, and has strong adhesion to various substrates. It supports high-throughput manufacturing while providing durable protection for sensitive components.

### What is the shelf life of ABChimie&reg; 9111 UV?

ABChimie&reg; 9111 UV has a shelf life of 12 months when stored at 5&ndash;30&deg;C in tightly sealed, opaque containers. The product must be sealed away from excessive heat (>40&deg;C). Before use, allow the product to equilibrate for 24 hours at 18&ndash;32&deg;C for optimal performance. Due to settling, glue should be mixed before use.

### What happens after the shelf life?

Using ABChimie&reg; 9111 UV past its shelf life may alter viscosity, affecting uniformity and application performance. Always use an in-date product for reliable results.

### What is the recommended curing method for ABChimie&reg; 9111 UV?

ABChimie&reg; 9111 UV is UV-curable and should be cured with a mercury lamp. The minimum UVA dose is 500 mJ/cm&sup2; for a 100 &mu;m thickness. The LED-curable version is ABChimie&reg; 9111 UV LED. Higher UVA doses do not negatively affect final properties.

### What is the maximum thickness for ABChimie&reg; 9111 UV?

ABChimie&reg; 9111 UV can be applied up to 4mm due to its thixotropic properties, allowing high-thickness deposits without sagging.

### What safety precautions should I take?

Use ABChimie&reg; 9111 UV in a well-ventilated area, avoid skin and eye contact, and follow all Safety Data Sheet (SDS) guidelines. Keep away from open flames and sparks.

### Can I adjust viscosity?

ABChimie&reg; 9111 UV can be customized for variable viscosities. Contact our team for guidance.
