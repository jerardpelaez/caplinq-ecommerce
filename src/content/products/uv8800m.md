shortDescription: "LOCTITE UV8800M epoxy encapsulant is developed to meet high temperature thermal cycling specifications. It UV cures to form a hard translucent coating when exposed to UV light of sufficient intensity. The curing of the product is not inhibited by oxygen, resulting in excellent surface cure. LOCTITE UV8800M exhibits viscosity characteristics and dearated condition that make it suitable for accurate dispensing with excellent shape control. This encapsulant is typically used for CSP and BGA packages and is, among others, used on Glass, Epoxy, Polyimide and Polyester substrates. UV Cure Condition Medium pressure mercury lamp: Light Dose, mW/cm² 100 Exposure Time, seconds 2 UV radiation, , nm (UVA) 315 to 400"

LOCTITE UV8800M can be cured by irradiation with ultraviolet and visible light as well as LED-UV light with single wavelength distribution of sufficient intensity. Cure rate and depth of cure depend on the intensity, spectral distribution of the light source, exposure time and light transmittance of the substrate through which the light must pass.
