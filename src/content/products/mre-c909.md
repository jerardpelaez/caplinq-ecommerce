shortDescription: "Chemlinq MRE-C909 Mold Release is a carnauba wax based, sprayable aerosol mold release agent. It contains no silicones or oils and is therefore not only compatible but complementary to epoxy molding compound and other thermoset plastic molding. Alternative to MJGordon Permasil #909C Chemlinq MRE-C909 is a fully REACH and RoHS compliant carnauba wax mold release aerosol spray and does not contain trichloroethane (CAS: 71-55-6) or dichloromethane (CAS: 75-09-02). It is designed for mold release of epoxy molding compounds and was specifically formulated as an alternative to MJ Gordon Permasil #909C after MJ Gordon discontinued the production of this product. MRE-C909 is literally the 9th iteration, and serves as a reminder of the 8 previous unsuccessful formulation attempts before finally formulating MRE-C909. In order to have the best results during the production process, a thin, uniform thickness of MRE-C909 should be sprayed on the mold. The release agent has no build-up on the mold and should show a shiny surface when properly applied. Instructions for use: Frequently shake the container to agitate the wax which has the tendency to fall to the bottom of the can. (Note: Carnauba wax has a greater density than the solvents and propellant in the formulation) Hold the container upright with the actuator (spray nozzle) pointing toward a red mark on the mounting cup of the valve. Press the actuator to discharge the wax, from a distance of at least 30 cm from the mold surface, moving the container side to side.(Note: If you spray at the same spot for more than 2 sec, then you might overspray the mold surface with uneven wax) General Notes: If the spray actuator is too close to the surface, water condensation will happen on the mold surface and will cause contamination on the molded product. Spray distance of 30 cm will allow the evaporation of the solvent and propellant and will eliminate the condensed water vapor in the air. To ensure consistent formulation during use, MRE-C909 is only available in aerosol cans."

## MRE-C909 Development, Performance and Applications

Carnauba wax itself is nothing new. It is a natural wax derived from the a palm tree native to the northeastern Brazil. It is used in a wide variety of applications including automotive waxes, shoe polishes, dental floss coatings, and paper coatings. More importantly, it is used in the production of epoxy molding compounds themselves as the mold release agent.

Carnauba wax is the same natural mold release wax used in the manufacture of semiconductor epoxy molding compounds.

In mold release applications, carnauba wax is used because of its excellent release properties. It creates a thin and uniform coating on the mold surface, allowing the material to be released cleanly without sticking to the mold.

Teflon, silicone, and oils are all used as mold release agents, but none of them is as well suited to thermoplastic mold release as carnauba wax.

There is no silicone, Teflon or oil in the MRE-C909 formulation. While Teflon and silicone may be well-suited for rubber, they rarely have a place when working with liquid epoxy or epoxy molding compounds (EMC). Most semiconductor manufacturers use chunks of carnauba wax to break in new molds; MRE-C909 provides this same compatibility in a convenient, high-purity spray.

### REACH & RoHS Compliant: Chemlinq MRE-C909 does not contain chlorofluorocarbons, ozone-depleting substances, trichloroethane, or dichloromethane.

Chemlinq MRE-C909 is a non-silicone mold release agent developed specifically for transfer molding and compression molding. It is ideal for applications requiring a thin, uniform layer for best results. Due to its dryness, MRE-C909 provides the perfect balance of release and rustproofing.

#### Tips & Troubleshooting

- Shake the aerosol can frequently to avoid clogging.

- Maintain distance to ensure the required spray pattern.

- Spray evenly and quickly during production. Do not overspray.

- Used to rust proof metal molds while they are still hot.

## Alternative for MJ Gordon Permasil #909C

Chemlinq MRE-C909 is a proven alternative to MJ Gordon #909C. This carnauba wax-based spray is fully REACH and RoHS compliant. Just like the MJ Gordon version, it is an aerosolized solution of carnauba wax suspended in solvent. However, our compliant solvent and propellant ensure it can be used in European markets where legacy products are restricted.

## Evaluation of Mold Release Products

Semiconductor Grade Epoxy Molding Compound was tested with 5 different candidates

#### Incompatible Candidates

- Did not dry during the molding cycle

- Caused increased sticking in the mold

- Visual defects in molded bars were observed

- Offensive odor; burning eyes and irritation

#### Chemlinq MRE-C909 Results

- Processed equally well as MJ Gordon #909C

- No sticking or operator irritation

- Identical results to legacy benchmarks

- Very good release properties

Innovation Insight

## Design Features & Uniformity

#### Why is there a red dot?

The red dot is a "spray-through" indicator. It aligns the nozzle with the internal valve stem. By pressing down until the dot disappears, you ensure the spray can is being used efficiently with zero wasted product.

#### Why is there no "metal pea"?

MRE-C909 uses a modern solvent and propellant mixture that ensures proper homogeneity without an agitator ball. This REACH-compliant formulation stays blended, eliminating the need for a mixing ball.

Product Cross-Reference

## Alternatives & Compliance

There is no direct alternative for this product; rather, Chemlinq MRE-C909 is the engineered, REACH-compliant alternative to MJ Gordon Permasil #909C.

## Package Size Availability

To ensure consistent formulation during use, MRE-C909 is only available in aerosol cans.

Technical Support

## Guidelines for Troubleshooting Common Issues

Defect Description
Corrective Action

**Mold Sticking**

- Increase mold temperature and preheat material to eliminate moisture.

- Clean the mold and check for dents or undercuts.

- Ensure cavities have sufficient draft for easy removal.

**Porosity / Voids**

- Increase molding pressure and experiment with different plasticity levels.

- Reduce temperature and adjust closing speed to purge air.

**Blistering**

- Increase cure time and vent the mold at dead ends.

- Close mold slowly on low pressure first to allow gas to escape.
