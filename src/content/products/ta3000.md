shortDescription: Honeywell TA3000 is a one-part moisture cured silicone thermally conductive adhesive, used to bond the heat generating component with heat sink when exposure to moisture in the air. The cured material could function as excellent heat transfer media, fixing of electronic components and sealing protection against contaminants at the same time during application. Honeywell TA 3000 is a room temperature vulcanization adhesive that forms a curable adhesion layer between two surfaces with a little pressure and meanwhile offer good heat dissipation effect in use across multitude of applications. It exhibits a linear CTE of 102 ppm/°C and 10-20min of tack free time in room temperature. Honeywell TA 3000 can be used with manual or automatic dispense and cures at room temperature with 10-80% realtive humidity. It is not suggested to use it at highly confined or deep sections spaces and it is typically used for PCBA, LED assemblies, power units and automotive electronics.
