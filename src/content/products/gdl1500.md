shortDescription: "LINQCELL GDL1500 is a graphitized carbon plate, commonly used as a gas diffusion layer and electrode for fuel cells. Its through plane resistance is less than 13.5 m&Omega;cm2. The thickness is 1.5mm and is measured at 50 kpa. This material has been successfully used in assemblies for hydrogen production electrolyzer components as a gas diffusion layer and electrode. LINQCELL GDL1500 with a density of &plusmn;0.60 g/cm3 is a close, almost direct, alternative to the highly popular and discontinued Spectracarb 6060. Compared to it it has a resistivity of 90m&Omega;-cm instead of 100m&Omega;-cm. Shortly, we should be able to die cut circles and most designs that you might require. Air permeability of LINQCELL GDL1500 was evaluated using the ISO 5636-5 standard test method. Using a sample area of 0.1 in2 and an air volume of 300 mL, the measured air passage times were 9.30 s, 9.45 s, and 8.88 s (average: ~9.2 s)."
