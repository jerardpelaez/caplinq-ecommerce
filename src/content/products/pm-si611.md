Processing Instructions







Before mixing, stir both Part A and Part B to homogenize.




Mix components A and B according to the specified weight ratio. Stir thoroughly to ensure uniformity while preventing air from introduced into the mixture. Ensure contamination is avoided.




To ensure complete mixing of both parts, machine mixing and dispensing are recommended. Static and dynamic mixer can also be used for mixing.




Degas the mixture to remove the bubbles for about 10 minutes. Do not fill the container more than half full to prevent overflowing during degassing.




Gradually pour the mixed compound into the device being potted.




Allow the potted workpiece to cure. The curing process is influenced by temperature variations; generally, higher temperatures result in faster curing, while lower temperatures lead to slower curing.





Packaging


LINQBONDTM PM-SI611 Part A and Part B is available in 30 kg open top plastic buckets.




Storage and Handling


Store in a ventilated, dry, and clean environment at 30±5 °C. Keep away from fire and heat sources. It is strictly forbidden to store in outdoor environments. At proper storage conditions, both Part A and Part B have a shelf life of 6 months.
