shortDescription: LINQSTAT VCF-8S200K is a black, carbon-filled, electrically conductive polyethylene plastic film designed to provide both physical and static protection. Having a surface resistance of 200,000 ohm-sq, (2x105 Ω-sq) it offers medium-level static protection which means it effectively avoids accumulation of electric charge on itself and the products which it protects. Its easy-grounding nature makes it ideal for packaging where electrostatic contamination is a problem. Please note that this film is only surface conductive and not volume conductive. VCF-8S200K is useful in applications where the key is to balance cost versus performance. As a medium-level conductive plastic, the carbon-loading is such that it is low-enough to be cost-effective, while being high enough to meet the electrical requirements of military specification MIL-PRF-81705D Type II and MIL-P-82646A. It is typically used as an antistatic smartcard interleaver. VCF-8S200K film and its conductivity are unaffected by humidity and age. The film is heat-sealable, flexible and offers exceptional abrasion resistance. The film gives good thermal stability and has outstanding chemical resistance. It has a standard thickness of 8mil(0.2mm) is available in sheeting, tubing, V-fold and C-fold versions. Roll lengths and widths vary depending on thickness and application. Production batches from 2023 will have a Tolerance of ±100,000 ohms

In sheet form, LINQSTAT VCF, works as an antistatic plastic. For more sensitive pressure sensor applications, CAPLINQ recommends LINQSTAT XVCF-Series, which is a more-conductive series of polyethylene plastics. As an antistatic packaging plastic, it is also used as a antistatic interleaver for Smartcard (micromodule) applications to separate subsequent layers of smartcard chips in micromodule production.
