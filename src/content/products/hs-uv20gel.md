## Frequently Asked Questions About HumiSeal® UV20GEL



### What are typical applications for HumiSeal® UV20GEL?


HumiSeal® UV20GEL is ideal for protecting printed circuit board assemblies (PCBs) or for spot coating applications. Its non-sagging thixotropic consistency makes it suitable for:



- Automotive electronics (e.g., control units, under-the-hood components)

- Industrial electronics (e.g., ruggedized controls, sensors)

- Aerospace and defense electronics (e.g., modules, high-reliability assemblies)




Its fast UV cure and robust chemical resistance make it perfect for protecting sensitive components, especially where a thick or precise coating is required with a quick throughput.




### Why choose HumiSeal® UV20GEL over other conformal coatings?


HumiSeal® UV20GEL is a single-component, urethane acrylate-based gel that provides excellent chemical and environmental resistance. It offers a thixotropic (non-flowing) consistency for applications like dam-and-fill, encapsulating components, or creating a specific high-build protective layer. Its main advantage is its rapid UV cure, which allows for a full cure in seconds, significantly accelerating production times. The gel fluoresces under UV light for easy inspection of coverage. It is applied by dispensing, syringe, or hand-applied methods, offering flexibility for various production processes. It also has a secondary moisture cure mechanism for areas not exposed to UV light.






### What is the shelf life of HumiSeal® UV20GEL?


HumiSeal® UV20GEL has a shelf life of 6 months from the date of manufacture when stored sealed at room temperature (1 to 25°C). Before use, allow the product to reach room temperature for optimal dispensing performance.




### How should I clean tools after applying HumiSeal® UV20GEL?


To clean uncured HumiSeal® UV20GEL from tools, use a suitable solvent like acetone or an ester-based solvent. For cured material, a mechanical method is often required. Always ensure proper ventilation and use appropriate protective equipment. Consult the product's Technical Data Sheet (TDS) and Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for detailed recommendations.






### What happens to HumiSeal® UV20GEL after its shelf life?


After the shelf life, viscosity and curing characteristics may degrade, potentially leading to inconsistent dispensing or reduced protective performance. Use of expired material is not recommended as it may compromise coating quality.




### How do curing times vary for HumiSeal® UV20GEL?


The primary cure for HumiSeal® UV20GEL is UV light, which cures the coating in seconds to a few minutes depending on the UV intensity and thickness. A secondary moisture cure is active for areas that are shadowed from UV exposure, typically achieving a full cure in 7 to 10 days, depending on ambient humidity.






### What is the recommended thickness for HumiSeal® UV20GEL?


Due to its thixotropic nature and fast UV cure, HumiSeal® UV20GEL is designed for applications where high-build or encapsulated thicknesses are required. This is significantly thicker than standard conformal coatings and allows for dam-and-fill applications and glob topping.




### What are the differences between application methods for HumiSeal® UV20GEL?


HumiSeal® UV20GEL is applied by dispensing, syringe, or hand-applied methods due to its gel-like consistency. These methods are preferred for precise, high-build applications or for coating around components. Unlike liquid coatings, it is not suitable for spraying or dipping.






### What is the maximum operating temperature for HumiSeal® UV20GEL?


HumiSeal® UV20GEL is rated for continuous operation from –40°C to +125°C. Intermittent above +125°C is possible, but continuous use above the recommended temperature range may degrade coating integrity.




### What safety precautions should I take when using HumiSeal® UV20GEL?


Use in well-ventilated areas. The product may contain acrylates and other irritants, so prevent skin and eye contact by wearing appropriate protective equipment. Consult the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for detailed handling and disposal instructions.






### How can I ensure proper application of HumiSeal® UV20GEL?


The gel fluoresces under UV light, allowing easy inspection of coverage and uniformity, which is critical for high-reliability electronics manufacturing, especially for ensuring full component coating. This feature is crucial for confirming the initial UV cure has been applied to all intended areas.




### How does HumiSeal® UV20GEL perform in harsh environments?


HumiSeal® UV20GEL provides exceptional protection against moisture, chemicals, and mechanical stress. Its unique thixotropic consistency allows for a thick, non-flowing barrier, making it particularly effective in maintaining performance in humid and corrosive environments. It's well-suited for automotive, industrial, and aerospace applications that require rapid throughput and a durable barrier.
