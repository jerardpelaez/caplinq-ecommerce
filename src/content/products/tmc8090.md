  - Anti moisture
  - Low blue ray decay
shortDescription: OPTOLINQ TC-8090 is a high-performance optical epoxy specifically developed for white decorative and high reliability backlight LED encapsulation, just like TC8030 and TC8060. This mono-component epoxy achieves superior adhesion performance and great transmittance. It is an anti moisture formulation that is stable at high temperatures combining good package performance and long life. TMC-8090 is able to offer low blue-ray decay for outdoor LED applications and overall great light performance with >90% transmittance at 450nm. This is a developmental product, similar or superior to competitive solutions such as XX814, XX1000 and XX97. It is a highly reliable product that passes reflow thermal cycling test at 85°C @85%relative humidity and its light decline is <10% in RT/5mA @1000hrs.
