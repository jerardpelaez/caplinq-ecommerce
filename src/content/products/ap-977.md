shortDescription: "KESTER 977 is an advanced, organic, water-based, no-clean flux designed for achieving high-quality soldering results on electronic circuit board assemblies. This chemistry excels in wave soldering applications, providing reliable performance across most common surface finishes. KESTER 977 was specifically formulated to address common challenges in VOC-free, no-clean systems by significantly reducing solder bridging, ensuring cleaner, more reliable joints and improved productivity without compromising the long-term reliability of the assembly. Product Key Features Leaves a minimal, non-conductive, and non-corrosive residue that typically does not require cleaning. Biodegradable at pH 2.0 or greater Residues will not attack properly cured solder masks or FR-4 Epoxy-Glass laminate. Does not negatively impact the Surface Insulation Resistance (SIR) of the soldered assembly. Applications Suitable for wave soldering applications & high-throughput processes requiring high reliability. Note: Due to changes in REACH Regulations, this product is no longer sold into Europe or to European customers."
