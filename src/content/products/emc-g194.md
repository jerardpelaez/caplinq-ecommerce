shortDescription: "LINQSOL EMC-G194 is a green epoxy molding compound engineered for use in rectifier diodes, SMX, TO, and DIP semiconductor packages. It is designed for efficient, high-volume molding operations with excellent flow and low internal stress. This makes it ideal for devices with complex shapes or rigorous process requirements. EMC-G194 has high adhesion strength on leadframes, copper, and other common substrate materials, reducing delamination risks and ensuring mechanical stability during thermal cycling and high-temperature operation. LINQSOL EMC-G194 delivers high performance and reliability while meeting EU RoHS requirements and REACH Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC) restrictions. EMC-G194 seamlessly integrates advanced material properties, safety compliance, and superior performance for reliable semiconductor encapsulation. Product Key Features: Optimized Rheology for Enhanced Moldability: Allows for complete cavity fill, minimal wire sweep, and reduced void formation Low Stress Formulation: Minimizes stress exerted on the encapsulated die and bond wires during thermal cycling, significantly reducing the risk of delamination, die cracking, and bond wire deformation. High Adhesion for Robust Encapsulation: Crucial for preventing moisture ingress and delamination, which are primary failure mechanisms in encapsulated devices. The strong bond integrity ensures long-term protection against environmental factors and mechanical stresses. LINQSOL EMC-G194 is available in custom pellet dimensions.
