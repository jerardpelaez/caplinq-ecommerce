shortDescription: "DK15-0463 is an epoxy-based coating powder developed for the insulation of low-voltage busbars. It offers improved moisture resistance and dielectric strength along with a smooth surface appearance. The particle size distribution is optimized for use in large fluid bed coating operations. DK15-0463 has a UL Relative Thermal Index (RTI) rating of 130°C, making it ideal for applications requiring high thermal stability. Used for over 20 years by major power distribution companies for low-voltage outdoor bus bar applications, DK15-0463 provides a reliable coating with high edge coverage. The fusion bonded coating is smooth, tough, and moisture-resistant for applications up to 600V. DK15-0463 is UL recognized Particle size is optimized for the fluidized bed coating process. Advantages of DK15-0463 for Busbar Coating Excellent bed life—so important for large busbar coating operations Excellent moisture resistance, even in high temperatures and corrosive conditions Suitable for both copper and aluminum busbar coating Smooth surface allows closer bar spacing in busway An extremely reliable coating powder, used for decades in the power distribution industry Typical applications and uses of DK15-0463 Black include: Low Voltage (600V) Copper, Aluminum and Brass Busbars Outdoor busbar applications Switchgear Equipment for Power Distribution This product is no longer available. Some alternatives for busbar coating powders are: BCP-1509 Medium to high voltage insulation BCP-1507 One powder solution for all BCP-1504 Low voltage busbars BCP-1000 Low cost spray coating"
