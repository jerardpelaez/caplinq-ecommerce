shortDescription: "LOCTITE ABLESTIK QMI516 is a silver filled conductive adhesive for attachment of integrated circuits and components to metal leadframes advanced substrates, including: SBGA’s, PBGA’s, array packages, tape packs and CSP’s. This material is hydrophobic and stable at high temperatures. These features produce void-free bonds lines with excellent interfacial adhesion strength to a wide variety of organic and metal surfaces, including solder mask, BT, FR, polyimide, Au, Kapton™ and Mylar™. A package or device manufactured with LOCTITE ABLESTIK QMI516 will have good resistance to delamination and “popcorning” after exposure to reflow temperatures. The adhesive also has excellent electrical and thermal conductivity properties. LOCTITE ABLESTIK QMI516 can be cured in a conventional oven, on a snap cure oven, or utilize SkipCure™ processing on a die bonder or wire bonder. The material is formulated to produce cure onset below 100°C. This can reduce or eliminate the need to pre-dry organic substrates prior to the die attach process. LOCTITE ABLESTIK QMI516 is a long standing product with no plans to be discontinued. Nevertheless, the risk of running into raw material disruptions and minimum batch size challenges with QMI 516 over time is higher than with other high-volume runners. That’s why, for new applications, we recommend qualifying LOCTITE ABLESTIK 2100A with similar properties and applications. Snap Cure 10 seconds @ 150°C Oven Cure 15 minutes @ 150°C"

How do Bismaleimide based materials fair against bleeding?


Bleeding is a known “side effect” of QMI products based on BisMaleImide (BMI) resin. The relatively low BMI resin viscosity allows higher filler loading and this makes this resin popular for semiconductor die attach use (next to its higher temperature and moisture resistance vs epoxies for instance). By using very fast “snap cure” profiles like most semiconductor companies do, bleeding can be controlled. Acrylate resin based products like CA 3556HF show less bleeding in general.


Bleeding can be also controlled by surface treatments, curing process and adding anti-bleed agents to the adhesives.


Sometimes if you take the relatively short pot life at 25C and high reactivity of QMI resins into account, next to its higher bleeding and higher resin cost base, we could suggest to focus on CA 3556HF and lower silver content ICP 8282 for specific applications. It is all application dependent and we are happy to help you choose.
