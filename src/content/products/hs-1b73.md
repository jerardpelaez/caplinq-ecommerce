You can learn how to select a conformal coating in our latest blog.






### What is the shelf life of HumiSeal® 1B73?


HumiSeal® 1B73 has a shelf life of 24 months from the date of manufacture when stored at room temperature (0 to 35°C) in tightly closed containers. Prior to use, allow the product to equilibrate for 24 hours at 18 to 32°C to ensure optimal performance.




### How should I clean tools after applying HumiSeal® 1B73?


Tools and equipment used for applying HumiSeal® 1B73 (e.g., spray guns, brushes, or dipping tanks) can be cleaned using HumiSeal® Thinner 73. For removing the coating from PCBs during rework, use HumiSeal® Stripper 1080 or 1080A. Always use a lint-free cloth and ensure proper ventilation during cleaning.






### What happens to HumiSeal® 1B73 after its shelf life?


Past its 24-month shelf life, HumiSeal® 1B73 may experience changes in viscosity, which could affect application consistency and coating uniformity. Using expired product may lead to suboptimal performance, and the manufacturer will not be liable for quality or performance issues if expired material is used.




### Why do curing times vary for HumiSeal® 1B73?


Curing times for HumiSeal® 1B73 depend on environmental conditions and the chosen curing method. It cures at room temperature in 24 hours or at 76°C in 2 hours. Optimal properties are achieved after 7 days at room temperature, as the coating continues to stabilize and reach its maximum electrical and mechanical performance.






### What is the recommended thickness for HumiSeal® 1B73?


The recommended coating thickness for HumiSeal® 1B73 is 25 to 75 microns. This range ensures optimal protection without compromising flexibility or electrical performance. Thickness can be adjusted by controlling viscosity with HumiSeal® Thinner 73 during application.




### What are the differences between application methods for HumiSeal® 1B73?


HumiSeal® 1B73 can be applied via spraying (1:1 dilution with HumiSeal® Thinner 73), dipping (5–15 cm/min withdrawal rate), or brushing (for touch-up). Spraying and dipping are ideal for large-scale production, while brushing is suited for small repairs. Each method requires adjusting viscosity with Thinner 73 for uniform coating.






### What is the maximum operating temperature for HumiSeal® 1B73?


HumiSeal® 1B73 can withstand thermal shock from –65°C to +125°C, as per MIL-I-46058C testing (50 cycles). It is not recommended for continuous operation above 125°C, as prolonged exposure to higher temperatures may degrade its protective properties.




### What safety precautions should I take when using HumiSeal® 1B73?


The solvents in HumiSeal® 1B73 are flammable, so avoid open flames or sparks during application. Use in a well-ventilated area to prevent inhalation of vapors or spray mist, and avoid skin and eye contact. Always consult the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) prior to use for detailed safety guidelines.






### How can I ensure proper application of HumiSeal® 1B73?


HumiSeal® 1B73 fluoresces under UV light, allowing for easy inspection of coating coverage. After application, use a UV light source to check for uniform coating and ensure there are no missed areas, which is critical for high-reliability electronics manufacturing.




### How does HumiSeal® 1B73 perform in harsh environments?


HumiSeal® 1B73 is designed for harsh conditions, with a moisture insulation resistance of 7.0 × 10¹⁰ ohms (70GΩ) and fungus resistance per ASTM G21. It maintains performance in humid, mechanically stressful, or temperature-cycling environments, making it ideal for mission-critical systems.
