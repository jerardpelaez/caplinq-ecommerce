### Will I have any issues with fretting(friction) with Greases?


After conducting a thermally degrading test you might realise that these greases are highly filled(~94.5% residual mass). Can this be a cause for concern when it comes to fretting and friction? The short answer is no.


The long answer is that Zinc oxide and aluminum oxide are common fillers in greases and other TIMs. These materials are also used in our phase change TIMs and there has rarely been any issues with fretting (friction) during dispensing or other applications. Fretting is only a concern with boron nitride as filler. Friction related impact is also minimal on low viscosity greases. So you are safe.
