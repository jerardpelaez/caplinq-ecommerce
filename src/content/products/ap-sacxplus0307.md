shortDescription: ALPHA SACX Plus 0307 is a next generation lead-free alloy suitable for use as a replacement for SnPb, SAC305 and other low silver SAC alloys including the original SACX 0307 in wave solder, lead tinning and rework processes. SACX Plus 0307 has been engineered for improved copper dissolution performance during the long hot exposure times associated with rework and lead tinning. The SACX Plus 0300 variant is used as a replenishment alloy in solder baths with elevated copper levels. As with all Alpha Metals bar solder, Alpha&rsquo;s proprietary Vaculoy&reg;manufacturing process is used to remove certain impurities, particularly oxides. The product is further enhanced with the addition of other materials designed to further reduce drossing, increase wetting speed and force and improve joint cosmetics. Product Key Features Manufactured using Alpha&rsquo;s proprietary Vaculoy&reg; process to remove impurities and oxides Enhanced copper control Reduced dross formation Superior wetting performance Applications Ideal for wave solder, lead tinning and rework processes.

### Application Guidelines

ALPHA SACX Plus 0307 is suitable for wave soldering, lead tinning and reworking through hole and surface mount components in a lead-free process. It is suited to single side and relatively complex, dual sided mixed technology boards. A solder pot temperature of 255 to 265 &deg;C (491 to 509 &deg;F) is recommended with a contact time 2.3 to 3.5 seconds. For suitable wave solder fluxes, contact your local sales representative. Lead free Reclaim services including dedicated lead free containers is also available, consult your local Alpha sales office.
