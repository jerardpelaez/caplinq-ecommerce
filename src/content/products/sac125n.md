sellingPoints:
  - Lead-Free Solder Spheres
  - Lowest cost Sn/Ag/Cu Alloy
  - Nickel Dopped, hence the SACNi name
shortDescription: "LINQALLOY SAC125N Solder Spheres are lead-free Tin/Silver/Copper alloys that contain 98.3% Tin (Sn), 1.2% Silver (Ag), 0.5% Copper (Cu) and 0.05% Nickel (Ni) and is often written as Sn98.3Ag1.2Cu0.5 and called SAC125Ni. SAC125N Solder Spheres contain a small amount of Nickel for anti-oxidation and are used by companies working with BGA, CSP, LBGA, PBGA and CBGA components who have made the transition to Lead-free (Pb-free) soldering. Features: Lowest Cost Sn/Ag/Cu Alloy Excellent Fatigue Resistance Compatible with all Flux Types Excellent Solder Joint Reliability Best Wetting Sn/Ag/Cu Alloy Nickel Doped, hence the SAC125Ni name Furthermore, each jar has a clear label on the lid specifying the solder ball diameter as well as a label on the front identifying the alloy type, the quantity of spheres in the jar, the date of manufacture, and the product lot (or batch) number. This batch number is also tied to a certificate of conformance that is also provided with the solder spheres and ensures the SAC105 solder spheres meet the following quality criteria: Tin (Sn): 98.3% Silver (Ag): 1.2% Copper (Cu): 0.5% Nickel (Ni): 0.05% Melting Temperature (Solidus): 217&deg;C Melting Temperature (Liquidus): 219&deg;C Sphericity : Within 1.5% Diameter Tolerance 0.22mm - 0.48mm (220&micro;m - 480&micro;m) : &plusmn; 0.010mm (&plusmn; 10&micro;m) 0.50mm - 0.762mm (500&micro;m - 762&micro;m) : &plusmn; 0.025mm (&plusmn; 25&micro;m)"

### What do I get when I buy SAC125N Solder Spheres from CAPLINQ?

The advantage of ordering solder spheres online at CAPLINQ.com is that you can be sure of the quality. The solder spheres you receive are originally manufactured solder spheres packed into jars with inert gas (nitrogen). We do not repack the solder balls we receive, so the jars you will receive have never been opened, thus ensuring the quality of the product you receive. The lid of the jar is also always sealed with a shrink-wrapped plastic wrap ensuring that the solder spheres do not oxidate in the jar.
