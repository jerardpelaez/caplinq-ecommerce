shortDescription: OPTOLINQ LE-5031HY is a low-viscosity, two-part, halogen-free epoxy resin with high transparency and a high-gloss finish. It offers robust stability in acidic and alkaline environments, good anti-aging properties, high durability even under extreme temperatures, and superior scratch and abrasion resistance. For specific color requirements, LE-5031HY can be customized using color or opaque pastes. The LE-5031HY is the anti-yellowing resistant version of LE-5031 OPTOLINQ LE-5031HY is a suitable coating for metal and polymer surfaces, providing a polished finish and excellent surface integrity. It is the preferred choice for coating solar cell panels, transparent potting of electronic components for insulation and moisture-proofing, high-voltage coil potting, and room temperature potting of capacitors and transformers. LE-5031HY complies with ROHS and REACH standards, offering a reliable solution for encapsulation and sealing applications. Cure Schedule 24h @ 25°C 2-4h @ under 60C° 1h @ 100°C

### Anti-yellowing Performance


The following optical images of cured LE-5031HY samples (10 and 30 g) demonstrate its anti-yellowing capability under two distinct conditions: exposure to 70 °C for 18 hours and to 85 °C at 85% RH for 24 hours.




### Recommended Curing Conditions


Cure at 25 °C for 24 h or at 100 °C for 1 h. These guidelines offer recommended curing parameters. Define the exact curing parameters to align with your product specifications.


### Precautions for Use



- Follow the recommended mixing ratio (3:1) precisely.

- Make sure to stir the mixture thoroughly. Use the mixture as soon as possible.

- When the relative humidity >85%, the solid surface can absorb moisture from the air, producing a white fog. Room temperature curing is not advised when the relative humidity is greater than 85%. Instead, consider heated curing as a recommended alternative.

- After each use, seal the container tightly to prevent moisture from infiltrating and compromising the product's quality.




### Storage and Handling


Store in a ventilated, dry, and clean environment. Keep away from fire and heat sources. It is strictly forbidden to store in outdoor environments. At proper storage conditions, Part A and Part B both have a shelf life of 180 days. Shelf life can be extended by using cold storage.
