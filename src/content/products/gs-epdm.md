shortDescription: "LINQSEAL GS-EPDM gaskets consist primarily of ethylene (comprising 45–75%), along with propylene and diene monomers. This unique composition provides the gaskets with exceptional versatility and durability. The diene monomers contribute to the formation of a cross-linking structure, enhancing the mechanical properties, such as elasticity, and significantly increasing resistance to aging. This rubber material exhibits high resistance to a wide range of environmental factors, including heat, cold, ozone, steam, electricity, UV rays, abrasion, and water, making it a preferred choice for various outdoor and challenging conditions. Compared to silicone and other polymers, EPDM boasts a higher tensile strength. Overall, LINQSEAL GS-EPDM is a cost-effective solution with outstanding performance in demanding outdoor environments. Custom LINQSEAL GS-EPDM gaskets can be tailored precisely to your specifications and drawings. The thickness ranges from 0.5 to 5.0 millimeters. The maximum dimensions are 1500 × 1500 mm2, while the minimum dimensions are 100 × 100 mm2. Key Features: High tensile strength High abrasion and weather resistance Good temperature stability (–57 °C to 150 °C) Highly Recommended As: Outdoor sealing material Flat gaskets for water electrolyzers and fuel cells"
