sellingPoints:
  - Encapsulant - DAM
  - High purity
  - Exceptional thermal stability
shortDescription: LOCTITE® ECCOBOND FP4451TD damming material is designed as a flow control barrier around areas of bare chip encapsulation. It is designed for applications requiring a taller, narrow dam while also being ionically cleaner. LOCTITE® ECCOBOND FP4451TD is the best DAM option available and it replaces the FP4451. "TD" stands for Tall Dam and implies that it has much better thixotropic properties. Due to the viscosity variation you can adjust the needle diameter in order to use the same DAM tool settings as with FP4451. Recommended Cure Schedule 30 minutes @ 125°C plus 90 minutes @ 165°C
