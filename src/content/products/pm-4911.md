sellingPoints:
  - Low stress silicone potting gel
  - Low viscosity, good leveling, and bubble-free curing
  - Excellent long term temperature resistance
shortDescription: LINQBOND PM-4911 is a two-component, low-stress transparent packaging adhesive. When the two components are mixed in a 1:1 ratio (by volume), they cure into a soft silicone gel. This gel offers buffering, shock absorption, insulation, waterproofing, and moisture-proof functions for electronic components. With a very low modulus, it generates minimal internal stress and exhibits robust resistance to cold and heat shock. LINQBOND PM-4911 also exhibits excellent adhesion on various surfaces, making its suitable for insulating a wide array of electronic components. PM-4911 is an ideal potting material for IGBTs, displays, and precision components.

### Precautions before Use



- Avoid contact with condensed silicone rubber, its gas, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, and other chemicals, including heavy metals, as they may inhibit curing of the product.

- Maintain a clean and ventilated workplace, using extraction trunks when necessary.

- Wear appropriate protective equipment and minimize direct contact with the human body. Refer to the Material Safety Data Sheet (SDS) before use.




### Storage and Handling


Store in a well-ventilated, dry area below 25 °C, away from fire and heat sources. Avoid outdoor storage. For extended shelf life, consider cold storage. Shelf life is 12 months under recommended conditions.
