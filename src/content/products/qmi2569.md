shortDescription: LOCTITE ABLESTIK QMI 2569 is a wide temperature processing, no-dry, silver glass die attach adhesive for the attachment of integrated circuits in both solder seal and glass seal hermetic packages. The material can allow the simultaneous processing of die attach and leadframe embedding, while producing a void-free bondline for maximum thermal dissipation. LOCTITE ABLESTIK QMI 2569 shows excellent adhesion when processed between 380°C to 440°C for small die (.300” x .300”), and between 390°C to 440°C for large die. Excellent RGA moisture results are acquired through the use of lead borate glass. This paste can only be used in hermetic packages. The QMI 2569 also offers improved processability by allowing in-line drying during the firing process on die as large as .800” x .800”. Either multi-needle or starfish can apply the material. LOCTITE ABLESTIK QMI2569 can only be used in hermetic packaging applications.

Firing profile The firing process for Ag-glass (Silver-Glass) involves the vehicle removal and sintering of the silver-glass composite into a dense, fired film. These steps are conveniently accomplished in a multizone belt furnace with an oxidizing atmosphere (clean dry air). Optimal temperature ramp rates for solvent removal during organic burnout and densification during sintering of the solids can be obtained through proper temperature programming of each zone and belt speed.

Check the Technical datasheet for target ramp rates for temperature ranges between 40 to 280&deg; C and for die sizes between 5x5 to 20x20 mm. For rectangular die, the largest dimension is typically used to determine the range, and recommended ramp rates decrease as die sizes increase. Ramp rates become significantly faster as the devices progress on the belt to sequentially higher temperature zones in the furnace. Small die can be ran on a large die profile. For example, some customers fire 5 mm die with the 15 mm die profile. Ramp rate is not critical for temperature above 280&deg;C. Regulatory details

Amendment to Annex III of Directive 2011/65/EU (RoHS)

As per the updated directive, points 7(c)-I now state :

7(c)-I Electrical and electronic components containing lead in a glass or ceramic other than dielectric ceramic in capacitors, e.g., piezo electronic devices, or in a glass or ceramic matrix compound. Applies to all categories and expires on 30 June 2027.

Regarding LOCTITE ABLESTIK QMI 2569 :

- The product contains lead due to presence of CAS 65997-18-4 (Frits, chemicals containing lead)

- Please refer to the Regulatory Data Sheet (RDS), RoHS Letter and Safety Data Sheet (SDS) in the Document section

It is important to note that LOCTITE ABLESTIK QMI 2569 is NOT an electrical or electronic material.

Therefore, the exemption under RoHS Annex III applies only to customers who incorporate this product into electrical or electronic components.
