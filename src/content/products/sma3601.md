shortDescription: LINQBOND SMA3601 is a one-component epoxy designed for chip bonding. This product has medium viscosity, high thixotropy, and can cure quickly at low temperatures. It is suitable for screen printing and dispensing applications. The product forms strong cured shapes without stringing or slumping, even at high-speed dispensing and with very small dots. The hardened surface of this product does not exhibit surface oiliness. Once cured, LINQBOND SMA3601 offers excellent adhesive strength, electrical insulation properties, and superior chemical and solvent resistance. Stable adhesive strength can be achieved with various SMT (Surface-Mount Technology) applications. This product is well-suited for electronic device encapsulation and chip bonding.
