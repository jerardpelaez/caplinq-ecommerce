shortDescription: "LINQALLOY SW-SAC305 solder wire is a lead-free Tin/Silver/Copper alloy that contains 96.5% Tin (Sn), 3% Silver (Ag), and 0.5% Copper (Cu) and is often written as Sn96.5Ag3.0Cu0.5. SAC305 Solder Wire is the least expensive of the two industry standard lead-free solder wires (the other being SAC405) and is used by companies working with BGA, CSP, LBGA, PBGA and CBGA components who have made the transition to Lead-free (Pb-free) soldering. LINQALLOY SW-SAC305 solder wire presents a highly reliable solution for various soldering applications, leveraging its superior composition and performance characteristics. Comprising 96.5% tin, 3% silver, and 0.5% copper, this solder wire offers a balanced blend of properties optimized for exceptional solder joint integrity and longevity. With a melting temperature of approximately 217-220°C, SAC305 solder wire ensures efficient and precise soldering operations across a wide range of electronic assembly processes. Its carefully engineered formulation promotes excellent wetting and flow properties, facilitating uniform solder joint formation and minimizing the risk of solder defects such as voiding and bridging. Features: Lowest Cost Sn/Ag/Cu Alloy Excellent Fatigue Resistance Compatible with all Flux Types Excellent Solder Joint Reliability Best Wetting Sn/Ag/Cu Alloy"

Each spool has a clear label on the lid specifying the solder wire diameter as well as a label on the front identifying the alloy type, the date of manufacture, and the product lot (or batch) number. This batch number is also tied to a certificate of conformance that is also provided with the solder wires and ensures the SAC305 solder wires meet the following quality criteria:



- Tin (Sn): 96.5%

- Silver (Ag): 3%

- Copper (Cu): 0.5%

- Melting Temperature (Solidus): 217°C

- Melting Temperature (Liquidus): 219°C

- Spheroid Tolerance : Within 1.5%
