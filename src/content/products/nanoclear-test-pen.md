### How to apply the Nanoclear Test Pen






STEP 1 ⇨ CLEAN




STEP 2 ⇨ TEST




STEP 3 ⇨ INTERPRET RESULTS








The surface must not be contaminated prior to testing.


To use the pen, place the stencil on a clean, level surface. Ensure the stencil is at room temperature. Then, draw the test pen across the stencil surface to be tested. Make three passes and evaluate the third pass only.


PASS - If the third ink swath beads up, tears apart, or shrinks into a thin line then this surface has the Aculon NanoClear® fluxophobic coating on the surface.


FAIL - If the third ink swath remains wetted (outline appears) on the test sample for three seconds or more then this surface does not have the Aculon NanoClear® fluxophobic coating on the surface. Apply NanoClear Fluxophobic stencil treatment.












### Application Tips



- Discard contaminated test pens.

- Use a “Fresh” test pen. NanoClear Test pens are good for 6 months from the production date.

- Never re-test the same location. Move along the sample or test a new area.

- Clean the test area with IPA or DI water and a clean room wipe prior to using the stencil.
