shortDescription: MCN T20 is a Wax conditioning compound that can be applied via transfer molding. The continuous molding and curing of molding compounds accumulates residues on the metal surface of the mold, making it lose its release ability and causing the surface quality to decay as a result. It is an amazing solution for those that don't want to stop the production process at all. You clean with a few shots of transfer cleaning compounds, you condition with MCN T20 and you keep your production running literally 24/7. MCN T20 Wax compound has good workability with minimal odor and exceptional fluidity. It is able to easily fill deep cavities with excellent wax emitting that spreads a thin and lasting layer of releasing agent to help recover the release ability of the mold.

Where does this fit in the cleaning and conditioning process?


Conditioning with wax compounds or sheets are the two final steps of the cleaning process.



- Remove mold stains, and recover the cleanliness of mold die surface

- Decompose mold stains, by the effects of dissolving, wrapping and grinding

- Reduce the adhesion of mold stain to metal surface, by cleaning agents

- Wrap and remove mold stains by polymer cross linking at high temperature Cleaning

- Recover the release ability of mold die for molding compounds

- Spread a thin and lasting layer of releasing agent (wax)
