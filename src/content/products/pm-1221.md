### Processing Instructions



- Mix component A and B according to specified ratio. Stir thoroughly to ensure uniformity while preventing air to be introduced into the mixture.

- Degas the mixture to remove the bubbles for about 5 minutes. Do not fill the container more than half full to prevent overflowing during degassing.

- Gradually pour the mixed compound into the device being potted. If the ambient temperature is around 5 °C, preheat components A and B to around 15 °C.

- Allow the potted workpiece cure at room temperature until the surface is dry. Full curing typically occurs within 24 hours. The curing process is influenced by temperature variations; generally, higher temperatures result in faster curing, while lower temperatures lead to slower curing.




### Precautions for Use



- Use the mixture promptly after combining components A and B to prevent a significant increase in viscosity.

- If the components have been stored for an extended period and exhibit precipitation or stratification, they should be thoroughly mixed before use. Component B is prone to crystallization at low temperatures; therefore, it should be stored in a warmer environment to melt prior to use, ensuring product performance remains unaffected.




Please note that the provided information is based on available data and typical conditions. For specific applications and detailed test results, refer to the actual test data and conduct appropriate certifications.


### Storage and Handling


Store in a ventilated, dry, and clean environment below 25 °C and 50% RH. Keep away from fire and heat sources. It is strictly forbidden to store in outdoor environments. At proper storage conditions, Part A and Part B has a shelf life of 6 months. Shelf life can be extended by using cold storage.
