shortDescription: "Aculon Nanoproof 3-01 is a highly effective electronic coating series designed to provide superior protection against moisture, chemicals, and corrosion for a wide range of electronic applications. With the discontinuation of the popular 3M Novec product line, the Aculon Nanoproof 3.0 series offers a readily available and accessible alternative for industries that require robust protection for their electronic devices. Aculon Nanoproof 3-01 with 1% Fluoroacrylate solids, forms a thin, transparent layer that provides excellent anti-wetting and anti-stiction properties, protecting electronic devices from harmful elements. With this amount of solids, it manages to reach a coating thickness of less than 1um. The coating also offers electrical insulation properties, reducing the risk of electrical shorts and failures of PCBs and Electrical components. The Aculon Nanoproof 3.0 series comes in different grades, with Aculon Nanoproof 3-01 allowing such a thin coating that doesn't even have a direct alternative on 3M Novec products It is ideal for use in harsh environments, making it a popular choice in industries such as automotive, aerospace, and defense. Aculon Nanoproof 3-01 is easy to apply, and its transparent coating ensures that it does not interfere with the aesthetics or functionality of electronic devices. It is suitable for use on a variety of electronic applications, including printed circuit boards, sensors, switches, and connectors. Applications: Moisture, chemical, and corrosion protection for printed circuit boards and electrical components Anti-wetting and anti-stiction in many diverse applications"
