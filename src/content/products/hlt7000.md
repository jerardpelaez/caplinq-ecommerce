shortDescription: Honeywell HLT 7000 High TC Hybrid TIM is a two-component, dispensable thermal gap filler, which offers high thermal conductivity and long-term reliability. This product is easy to dispense and rework, making it ideal for high volume manufacturing. Honeywell HLT 7000 marks the start of the High end TIM product line. It has a thermal conductivity of 7.0 W/mK accompanied with high reliability and ease of dispense. It can be cured after two-component mixing and can be cured faster under higher temperature. Its high compressibility minimizes thermal resistance at interfaces, while maintaining excellent performance during reliability testing. You probably noticed the lack of information and product properties. Since those are top notch products, we go to certain extends to protect Honeywell's IP and competitive advantages. A plethora of information, including additional data, images and samples are available once an NDA is in place. Contact us for more details.
