shortDescription: "LINQALLOY In100 Pure Indium Solder Spheres are a unique class of solder balls. This alloy is unique in that it alloys you to solder to non-metals, such as glass, quartz or ceramic. This is particularly useful in applications such as battery manufacturing and others where the two parts in questions are not of the same metal type, or not even made of metal at all. The alloy, as the name implies is 99.99% pure indium and as such is written simply as In100. Features: Solder Balls are made using 100% pure Indium Low-Eutectic melting temperature of 156.6&deg;C Allows soldering to non-metals such as glass, quartz and ceramic Furthermore, each jar has a clear label on the lid specifying the solder ball diameter as well as a label on the front identifying the alloy type, the quantity of spheres in the jar, the date of manufacture, and the product lot (or batch) number. This batch number is also tied to a certificate of conformance that is also provided with the solder spheres and ensures the In100 solder balls meet the following quality criteria: Indium (In): 100% Melting Temperature (Eutectic): 156.6&deg;C Sphericity: Within 1.5% Diameter Tolerance 0.1mm - 0.25mm (100&micro;m - 250&micro;m) : &plusmn; 0.0050mm (&plusmn; 5&micro;m) 0.3mm - 0.45mm (300&micro;m - 450&micro;m) : &plusmn; 0.010mm (&plusmn; 10&micro;m) 0.5mm - 0.89mm (500&micro;m - 890&micro;m) : &plusmn; 0.020mm ( &plusmn; 20&micro;m)"

### What do I get when I buy IN100 Solder Spheres from CAPLINQ?

The advantage of ordering solder spheres online at CAPLINQ.com is that you can be sure of the quality. The solder spheres you receive are originally manufactured solder spheres packed into jars with inert gas (nitrogen). We do not repack the solder balls we receive, so the jars you will receive have never been opened, thus ensuring the quality of the product you receive. The lid of the jar is also always sealed with a shrink-wrapped plastic wrap ensuring that the solder spheres do not oxidate in the jar.

Furthermore, each jar has a clear label on the lid specifying the solder ball diameter as well as a label on the front identifying the alloy type, the quantity of spheres in the jar, the date of manufacture, and the product lot (or batch) number. This batch number is also tied to a certificate of conformance that is also provided with the solder spheres and ensures the In100 solder balls meet the following quality criteria:

- Indium (In): 100%

- Melting Temperature (Eutectic): 156.6&deg;C

- Spheroid Tolerance : Within 1.5%
