shortDescription: "LINQBOND LB-FL501 is a high-performance, one-component fill epoxy encapsulant specifically designed for demanding semiconductor applications. Formulated with a low thermal expansion coefficient (CTE1: 23.2 ppm/°C, CTE2: 76.6 ppm/°C), LB-FL501 provides exceptional thermal stability and protects sensitive components from mechanical stress and environmental factors. Its excellent operability combined with a viscosity of 37,000 cps at 25°C ensures easy handling and precise dispensing, while its strong adhesion and chemical resistance contribute to the overall reliability of electronic assemblies. LINQBOND LB-FL501 epoxy encapsulant offers superior resistance to a wide range of chemicals and solvents, safeguarding components from degradation. Additionally, LB-FL501 exhibits outstanding heat shock resistance, making it suitable for applications that experience rapid temperature fluctuations. Typical applications include IC memory cards, chip carriers, hybrid circuits, chip-on-board, multi-chip modules, BGA, and pin grid arrays. It comes in 5, 10, 30 and 50cc syringes. Cure Schedule 30 minutes @ 135°C plus 90 minutes @ 175°C"
