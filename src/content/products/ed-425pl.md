shortDescription: LINQBOND ED-425PL is a two-component, room-temperature vulcanizing (RTV) epoxy adhesive system engineered for robust adhesion across diverse substrates, including various elastomers, thermoplastics, and sensitive electronic components. Its advanced formulation provides enhanced chemical inertness and resilience against severe environmental stressors. The cured adhesive exhibits exceptional mechanical properties, characterized by superior toughness and high resistance to thermal cycling and thermal shock. The polymerized surface is non-tacky and maintains a high-gloss finish. Furthermore, ED-425PL demonstrates minimal volatile organic compound (VOC) outgassing, making it suitable for applications requiring low contamination. This adhesive system is also optimized for a broad range of general-purpose potting and bonding applications, offering reliable encapsulation and structural integrity. LINQBOND ED-425PL features a user-friendly 1:1 mix ratio by volume, simplifying dispensing and reducing preparation time. It is fully compliant with international environmental directives, including the RoHS 2011/65/EU Directive, ensuring adherence to regulations on hazardous substances.

Directions for Use





Make sure that the substrate is clean and free of contaminants, such as dirt, grease, or mold release agents. A simple solvent wipe is often sufficient.




Thoroughly mix the parts A and B at a 2:1 weight ratio until a homogeneous mixture is formed.




Cure time will depend on actual production parts and equipment such as part geometry, materials, bondline thickness and the oven temperature.




For maximum bonding strength, apply the adhesive evenly to both surfaces to be joined.





Storage and Handling Store the container in a cool, dark place, away from direct sunlight. Exposure to sunlight may cause the resin and hardener to yellow. Shelf life when stored at room temperature between 14 and 34 °C is 365 days (12 months). Keep the container sealed and prevent moisture contamination when not in use and be sure to replace the lid immediately after each use.
