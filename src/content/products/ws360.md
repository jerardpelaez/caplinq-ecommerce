WS360 offers great workability and fume time that lasts ~10seconds. Need wax rich solutions? Contact us for additional information. WS360 Wax Conditioning Sheets are highly effective as a protection and release product. They have good flow characteristics which enable them to reach into the mold corners and thin gate areas easily. An additional advantage is that you will need no dummy lead frame or preheating. Used in combination with our RCS Rubber Cleaning Sheets, the short mold waxing and cleaning time will lead to reduced costs and will increase your overall efficiency and productivity.
