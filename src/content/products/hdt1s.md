shortDescription: "LINQTAPE HDT1S is an advanced solution for the visual detection of hydrogen gas leaks. This tape undergoes a rapid color change – transitioning from amber to black in as little as 10 seconds when exposed to hydrogen gas. The speed of this color transformation is contingent on factors like flow rate, temperature, time, and hydrogen percentage. LINQTAPE HDT1S provides an effective means of detecting gas leaks, significantly improving response time by facilitating the identification of intermittent leaks. Its high sensitivity allows it to detect hydrogen leaks with concentrations as low as 1% H2, making it a reliable safety net in various applications. Once exposed to hydrogen gas, LINQTAPE HDT1S maintains its altered color permanently, ensuring a lasting indication of exposure. Applying this tape is a seamless process, akin to typical silicone/polyimide PSA (Pressure Sensitive Adhesive), making it user-friendly. LINQTAPE HDT1S can be used in a variety of indoor or outdoor environments. It outperforms conventional portable or stationary sensors, offering superior detection and precise identification of hydrogen leak locations. This tape is less influenced by external factors such as wind, position, duration, or user skills. It provides comprehensive visibility, allowing for easy inspection of vertical and bottom faces. Key Features: Reliable hydrogen gas detection Can detect concentrations as low as 1% Color changing for ease of use Countless applications"

What happens if these tapes are exposed to higher temperatures? LINQTAPE HDT1S is a Polyimide tape with a Silicone adhesive that is reactive to Hydrogen. When it comes to materials, this is very similar to our PIT1S so the operating temperature is 260°C. The problem lies with the reactive nature of the tape. The higher the temperature, the lower the time it takes to detect H2. Since some Hydrogen applications are in the negative °C, we know that it will take much, much longer for the tape to react at cryo temperatures.


On the upper limit, we have tested it for 6 months at 60°C and it works fine. We don't know how the tape would react in higher temperatures though. Technically, the materials should be OK but the high temp will probably affect the reactivity and cause all kinds of issues. The entire idea with H2 detection tapes is really to prevent things such as jet fire from happening by regular monitoring. In theory, we expect the tape to react since H2 will be present and the temperature caused by the jet fire will accelerate the reaction. In practice, we don't know.


it is important to note that the tape WILL react even with a very low % of H2 in the air (even 1% will suffice). It will just take much longer (hours) than if there were higher concentrations where you would expect a color change within a couple of minutes.
