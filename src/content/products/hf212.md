shortDescription: LOCTITE HF 212 solder paste is a halogen-free (no intended added halogen in formulation), no clean, low voiding Pb-free solder paste for PCB assembly. It is ideal for printing, with a fine pitch capability (0.3 mm), stencil life (>8 hours), and abandon time (>4 hours) that are suitable for high-speed printing up to 150 mm/s. Additionally it is solderable on challenging surface finishes (CuNiZn and Copper OSP) and leaves clear residues for easy post-reflow inspection. LOCTITE HF 212 shows excellent solderability when reflowed in both air and nitrogen across a wide range of challenging surface finishes including immersion Ag, OSP-Cu, ENIG and CuNiZn.It is suitable for use with industry standard SAC ,high reliability SAC and low silver alloys SAC. It uses a halogen-free flux that passes IC with pretreatment IPC-TM-650 2.3.34/EN14582 and has a classification of ROL0 to ANSI/J-STD-004 Rev.B Please note that HF 212 comes in multiple alloys and powder types. The specifications below are for 90iSC Alloy. Please advise the TDS for additional information.
