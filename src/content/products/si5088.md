shortDescription: LOCTITE® SI 5088 is a translucent, UV and moisture cure alkoxy based silicone encapsulant (non-corrosive) used for gasketing, sealing and leak-proofing on glass, metals and ceramics. This thixotropic silicone exhibits reduced migration of liquid after the application to the substrate. LOCTITE® SI 5088 is a one component material that requires no mixing, forms a soft, highly flexible elastomer. and enhances the load bearing and shock absorbing characteristics of the bond area. It is ideal for glass, metals and ceramics but also suited to plastics. Fixturing time is up to 30 secs and service temperature from -60 to +200ºC.

Typical curing performance


Normal processing conditions will include exposure to sufficient UV light irradiance to effectively cure the material. Surface and/or atmospheric moisture will promote the cure of material in shadowed regions. Although functional strength is developed almost instantly due to the UV curing nature of LOCTITE® SI 5088™, increased cure properties are developed during 72 hours at ambient conditions.


Surface Cure


When curing with sufficient UV light irradiance, exposed material will cure dry to the touch in seconds. Atmospheric moisture cures material not exposed to UV light. Typically, non-UV light cured areas will skin over in approximately 11 minutes and become tack free in 14 minutes.


Depth of Cure


Shadowed areas rely on surface and/or atmospheric moisture to effect cure. Depth of cure is limited to approximately 6 millimeters and will take at least 24 hours to develop. Rapid depth of cure can be attained with focused UV light. The graph(s) below show the depth of cure obtained up to 60 seconds at two different levels of UV irradiance.
