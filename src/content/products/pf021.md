Recommended UV Cure


Light Dose, Joule/cm2: 0.4 to 1.0


For thicknesses >2.0 mils, a longer wavelength bulb is required e.g. Fusion "D". UV measurements were made with an EIT radiometer.


## 


How to use:


1. Mixing/Dilution



- Product is ready for use but should be mixed thoroughly using a plastic spatula. (Syringe-packed material needs no mixing).

- Mix smoothly from bottom of container , being careful not to whip air into the product.




2. Application



- LOCTITE EDAG PF 021 E&C should be applied in a glob over the entire surface if small devices, or along the outside leads of large devices.

- Its viscosity is designed to conform to the device and flow out over the substrate just prior to UV curing.

- Dot dispensing equipment should be selected based on the exact application, i.e., device size and production speed.




3. Cleanup



- Uncured resin may be cleaned with Isopropanol,
