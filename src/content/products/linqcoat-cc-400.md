## Product Description

LinQCoat CC-400 is an advanced acrylic-urethane conformal coating with a UV/moisture dual-cure mechanism, designed for high-throughput protection of printed circuit board assemblies in demanding environments. The dual-cure system provides immediate tack-free cure under UV exposure within seconds, while moisture-cure chemistry completes the cross-linking in shadow areas beneath components where UV light cannot reach. This ensures complete, void-free coverage across the entire PCB surface.

Applied at a recommended thickness of 25 to 75 µm by selective spray, dip, or automated valve dispensing, the CC-400 forms a transparent, flexible film that protects against moisture ingress, salt spray, fungus, dust, and chemical contamination. Its low viscosity of 0.25 Pa*s ensures excellent flow and wetting around fine-pitch components, solder joints, and tight spaces, while the UV-fluorescent additive allows easy inspection of coating coverage under black light.

The CC-400 delivers a dielectric strength of 35 kV/mm and a volume resistivity exceeding 10^14 Ohm*cm, providing robust electrical insulation against leakage currents and electrochemical migration in high-humidity environments. It meets the requirements of IPC-CC-830B and is qualified for use in automotive (AECQ-200 compatible), aerospace, and military electronics. The coating is available in 1 L, 5 L, and 20 L containers and is compatible with all major selective coating equipment platforms.

## Key Features

- UV/moisture dual-cure for complete shadow area coverage
- High dielectric strength (35 kV/mm) and insulation resistance
- Low viscosity (0.25 Pa*s) for excellent wetting of fine-pitch assemblies
- UV-fluorescent for easy inspection under black light
- Transparent, flexible film resists cracking under thermal cycling
- Meets IPC-CC-830B conformal coating standard
- Compatible with selective spray, dip, and valve dispensing

## Applications

LinQCoat CC-400 is used for conformal coating of PCB assemblies in automotive electronics (ECUs, sensor modules, body control modules), aerospace avionics, military communications equipment, and industrial control systems. It is particularly effective in protecting assemblies exposed to condensation, salt spray, and chemical splash in under-hood automotive, marine, and outdoor industrial environments. The CC-400 is also used in medical device electronics and consumer products where long-term reliability in humid climates is essential.
