shortDescription: LINQTAPE™ PIT0.5S-UT-Series is a high-temperature resistant polyimide tape. It combines our 0.5-mil (13 micron) thick polyimide film – the generic equivalent of DuPont® Kapton™ HN tape – with an ultra-thin 0.5mil silicone pressure adhesive, while still having excellent adhesion and mechanical strength at high temperatures. This tape is designed for both permanent and temporary bonding in many high temperature applications. These applications can be found in semiconductor, smartcard, electronic, automotive and general manufacturing industries. LINQTAPE™ PIT0.5S-UT-Series provides an excellent balance of electrical, mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties over a wide range of temperatures. It can be used in applications that may see temperatures up to 260°C (500°F). LINQTAPE™ PIT0.5S-UT-Series comes in 33 meter (36 yard) rolls of varying widths. LINQTAPE PIT-S polyimide films with silicone adhesive are available in a range of thicknesses, starting from 0,5 mil (12.7µm) thickness and up. Custom thicknesses are available upon request.
