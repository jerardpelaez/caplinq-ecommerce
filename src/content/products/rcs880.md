shortDescription: RCS 880 Rubber cleaning sheets are used to eliminate pollutants and stains formed on the mold surface. They perform well in a wide range of molds and are able to withstand up to 100t. These sheets offer an good cleaning performance with less smell and fumes. RCS 880 sheets have good flow characteristics which enable them to clean mold corners and thin gate areas easily. Unlike melamine cleaners, RCS cleaning sheets can even clean the air ventilation areas without causing mold abrasion or corrosion. At the same time there's no need for dummy lead frame or preheating, something that reduces cleaning time and leads to improved production time results and productivity. RCS 880 Rubber cleaning sheets can remove contamination of molds used in the semiconductor industry for products such as as integrated circuits, diodes, transistors, and LEDs in both physical and chemical mechanisms.

Difference between RCS 620 and RCS 880


RCS 880 have higher elastomer content (55%) compared to RCS 620 (40-50%) which makes it more flexible/elastic thus enabling it to reach corners and complex portions of the mold while cleaning.


In addition, RCS 880 has more concentrated cleaning ability since it has no solvent in the composition while RCS620 have additional propylene glycol compound that act as a solvent/plasticiser.
