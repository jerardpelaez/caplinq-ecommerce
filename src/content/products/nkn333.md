shortDescription: "LINQTape NKN 333 is a three-ply laminate film consisting of 3 mils of Polyimide (Kapton) laminated between 3 mils of Aramid (Nomex) paper from each side, resulting in a film with a total of 9 mil (10 mil nominal) thickness. Nomex paper is bonded to the Polyimide film at high temperature and results in a laminate with good dielectric properties, high heat resistance and high mechanical strength. NKN means Nomex - Kapton - Nomex. Both Nomex and Kapton are registered trademark names of Aramid paper and Polyimide film respectively. While the trademarks has expired a long time ago, the abbreviation for this kind of laminate remained NKN. Nomex Kapton Nomex (Aramid Polyimide Aramid) films are great insulators for slot, phase, turn to turn, liner and barrier applications in rotating motors. They can be used as transformer and inductor windings while being a popular choice for a wide range of electrical applications. Key Features: Good dielectric properties High heat resistance High mechanical strength Wide range of applications"
