shortDescription: "LINQTAPE™ PIT1A-ESD Series is a high-temperature resistant, antistatic-treated polyimide film mounted with an acrylic adhesive. It is designed for both masking and temporary bonding in many high-temperature applications in semiconductor, electronic, automotive, and other general manufacturing industries. LINQTAPE™ PIT1A-ESD Series provides an excellent balance of electrical, mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties over a wide range of temperatures. It has enhanced strength for puncture and tear resistance and can be used in applications that may see intermittent temperatures up to 155°C (311°F). LINQTAPE™ PIT1A-ESD Series comes as a standard in 36-yard (33m) lengths of varying widths, but longer rolls may be available upon request. Please note that batches after April 2024 will all come with a release liner. Key Features: Antistatic coating to dissipate electrostatic charge Pressure-sensitive acrylic adhesive Excellent insulating properties"
