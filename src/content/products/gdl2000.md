shortDescription: "LINQCELL GDL2000 is a high-performance graphitized carbon plate that can be used as a gas diffusion layer in fuel cells or porous transport layer in water electrolyzers. Its nominal thickness at 50 kPa is 2.00 (±0.1) mm. LINQCELL GDL2000 offers low through-plane electrical resistivity and voltage loss, which are crucial for excellent electrical performance during fuel cell or water electrolysis operations. Its low compressibility ensures that it maintains its porous structure, enabling optimal material transport for chemical reactions even under compression. This product can be graphitized at 1600°C and 2000°C. Higher graphitization results in better electrical performance and a more compressible material while significantly increasing the material cost. It is mainly recommended when resistivity is of the utmost importance. You can check our blog to find out how graphitization affects the structure and properties of carbon papers Key Features: Excellent through plane resistance (10.7 mΩcm2 @ 2000°C) High compressibility (1.94% @ 1600°C and 3.4% @2000°C) Very low impurities Cheaper and more cost efficient than sintered titanium Its high compressibility and porosity make it an excellent choice for optimal reactant transport to the catalyst layer, ensuring the best possible performance in various fuel cell applications. Its low electrical resistance, high thermal conductivity, and durability also make it ideal for use as a Porous Transport Layer (PTL) in PEM electrolyzers, PEMFCs, and PAFCs. Highly Recommended for: Porous transport layer for Water Electrolyzers Fuel Cell Gas Diffusion layer This highly graphitized carbon paper excels in meeting the stringent requirements of fuel cells and water electrolyzers, supporting catalysts and functional layers, facilitating gas and liquid transport, and conducting heat and electricity effectively."
