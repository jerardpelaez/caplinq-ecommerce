shortDescription: LINQTAPE™ DCT-PO165 is a frosted polyolefin (PO) tape used in the dicing process. It provides an excellent balance of electrical, mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties. Compared to a PET dicing tape, PO dicing tapes have the same strong adhesion but are more easily removed from the substrate. This makes it ideal for applications such as packaging substrates, or delicate substrates where gentler adhesion is required for easier removal. LINQTAPE™ DCT-PO165 can be peeled by using UV. To ensure a clean substrate after removing the tape, DCT-PO165 utilizes a technology through which after applying UV light, the adhesive (18,600 N/25mm) becomes less tacky (180 N/25mm), which facilitates the removal of the tape. This quality makes the tape ideal for glass, sensitive substrates, and applications for which the final product must be clean of any residue. DCT-PO165 is a 150µm PO film, with a one-sided 15µm acrylic adhesive layer, and backed with a PET liner. This product can be customized according to the customer's needs. Key Features Strong adhesion to prevent substrate damage Can be used with uneven surfaces Antistatic High transparency High flexibility High chemical resistance No residue after removal Application Ideas Masking Temporary bonding Assembly of delicate components Packaging substrates Glass (e.g. optical applications)
