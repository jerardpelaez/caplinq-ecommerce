shortDescription: HB4S Quartz sand Silica is produced from chemically treated and water washed high purity quartz, producing an Ultra high purity product. It has all of the benefits of the Quartz sand product line such as low alpha ray emissions, iron, chromium, manganium and copper accompanied by a whopping SiO2 content of 99.995%. HB4S is an inherently inert white product that can be used for any kind of optical application. Ultra high purity grade is commonly used as a filler powder in Semiconductor grade Epoxy molding compounds and Copper clad laminates as well as Silica glass for halogen lamp bulbs. HB4S is tested and controlled to rigorous standards which ensure consistent chemical and physical properties resulting in predictable and repeatable performance. As with our entire product line, the particle size distribution is flexible and adjustable to your needs.
