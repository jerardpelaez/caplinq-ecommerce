shortDescription: "LOCTITE ABLESTIK ICP 4015 is a silicone based, electrically conductive adhesive. It is specially designed for applications where both high flexibility and excellent conductivity are required. LOCTITE ABLESTIK ICP 4015 is engineered to maintain its flexibility and conductivity at elevated temperatures, up to 200ºC. This adhesive is also formulated to cure at temperatures as low as 80ºC. It is suitable for wearable electronics using flexible printed circuits requiring low temp (max 100ºC) cure. Cure Schedule: 30 minutes @ 80°C This is a Recommended schedule but it can vary per application. 60 minutes @ 80°C or 35 minutes @ 140°C will provide more consistent results."

DMA Analysis


CTE is always the one above Tg as the Tg is always so low in these products that a decent measurement below that temperature is almost impossible with our machines.
