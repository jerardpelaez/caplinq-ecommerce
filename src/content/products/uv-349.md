shortDescription: LINQBOND UV-349 is a medium-viscosity, single-component, ultraviolet (UV) curable adhesive formulated to bond across different types of substrates such as glass, various metals (e.g., aluminum, stainless steel), and polymers (e.g., polycarbonate, PMMA, PVC). UV-349 is formulated to achieve rapid photopolymerization upon exposure to UV radiation from conventional metal halide or mercury arc lamps. LINQBOND UV-349 has significant thermomechanical stability and chemical resistance, showing high tolerance to a wide array of solvents and maintaining its inherent toughness and flexibility across an extended operational temperature range. It is also forumated to have impact resistance and sustained bond integrity when exposed to environments with fluctuating temperatures. Product Key Features Flexible — effectively absorbs stress and vibration without leading to cracking or failure. Medium viscosity — allows adhesive to be workable and easily applied onto uneven surfaces without compromising bond strength. Compatible with diverse substrates — suitable for conding different types of glass, polymers, and metals.
