shortDescription: LINQBOND T262 is a medium to high strength permanent threadlocker suited for fasteners up to 3/4" (20mm) diameter from UNC to UNF series. It has high thixotropy and high adhesive strength for all types of metal fasteners. When cured, it has consistent strength and torque-tension relationship on industrial fasteners including those on degreased phosphate, stainless steel, black oxide, and zinc-plated steel over the entire recommended torque range for Grade 5 fasteners. T262 also has excellent resistance against most industrial solvents. Product Key Features Excellent adhesion and sealing on a wide variety of metal surfaces. 100% Solids Adhesive Formulation for minimized shrinkage and maximized bond integrity. Thixotropic liquid for controlled application and prevents dripping or migration. LINQBOND T262 has high lubrication for easy assembly and corrosion resistance under extreme environmental conditions, and can operate within temperatures of -50℃ to 150℃.
