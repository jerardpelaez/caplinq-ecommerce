shortDescription: Hysol GR900 Q1G2 is a similar but alternative version of Q1L4. While Q1L4 offers great HTRB performance, Q1G2 offers better electrical performance for DFNs and small QFNs. It is a black semiconductor-grade epoxy molding compound designed for the encapsulation and protection of quad-flat no-leads (QFN) and dual-flat no-leads (DFN). Hysol GR900 Q1G2 is a relatively softer, spherical silica filled (89%) high end epoxy, typically used for QFN and DFN packages. QFN and DFN packages are low-profile packages that are MAP molded. This means that the packages are molded together in one large mold and then separated by cutting through the entire package. Epoxy molding compounds made for these type packages, like Q1G2, must have a low warpage. Hysol GR900 Q1G2 is an environmentally "green" halogen free product, meaning that it doesn't contain any bromine, antimony or phosphorus flame retardants. It offers good adhesion after MSL 3 and meets UL 94 V-0 Flammability at 1/8 inch (3.18mm) thickness. If you are not after the electrical performance, then by all accounts GR 900 Q1L4 will probably be the better option.
