shortDescription: LINQTAPE™ PIT1N-FEP019 Series is a general purpose, high-temperature resistant HN polyimide film that is coated on one side with a 0.5 mil fluorinated ethylene propylene or FEP copolymer. LINQTAPE™ PIT1N-FEP019 Series is coated with an FEP fluoropolymer coating (F46) emulsified solution and sintered at high temperature to turn general purpose HN polyimide into an FN polyimide. By applying the FEP coating to the HN polyimide film, it is converted to a heat bondable film, which in turn provides a superior moisture barrier and improved chemical resistance.
