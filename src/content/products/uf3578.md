shortDescription: LOCTITE® ECCOBOND UF 3578 is a one-component, heat-curable epoxy underfill designed to provide mechanical reinforcement and encapsulation in surface mount PCB assemblies. Its thixotropic, fluorescent formulation makes it especially well-suited for applications involving capacitors, resistors, connectors, and WLCSPs, where precise flow control and post-process inspection are critical. This adhesive offers fast curing at 120 °C in just 10 minutes and is fully compatible with solder reflow processes, eliminating the need for separate curing stages. LOCTITE® ECCOBOND UF 3578 ensures excellent mechanical strength and thermal protection while maintaining ease of use. Applications Underfill for WLCSP, capacitors, resistors, and connectors Reinforcement and protection in SMT and PCB assembly Electronics requiring fast cure and reflow-process compatibility Optical inspection environments (fluorescent visibility)

Cure Profile



- 10 minutes at 120 °C (standard cure)




*Compatible with standard solder reflow processes


Thawing Instructions



- Allow container to reach room temperature before use.

- After removing from the freezer, set the syringes to standvertically while thawing.

- Thaw time typically 1 hour for 30/55cc syringe .

- Consult handling guide for more information.

- DO NOT open the container before contents reach 25 °Ctemperature. Any moisture that collects on the thawed containershould be removed prior to opening the container.

- DO NOT re-freeze. Once thawed to 25 °C, the adhesive shouldnot be re-frozen.




Storage & Handling





Store between 2–8 °C in original packaging




Work life and dispensing stability require proper thaw and dispense procedures
