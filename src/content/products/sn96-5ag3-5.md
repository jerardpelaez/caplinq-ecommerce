shortDescription: "LINQALLOY Sn96.5Ag3.5 Eutectic Leadfree Solder Spheres Solder Spheres are lead-free Tin/Silver alloys that contain 96.5% Tin (Sn) and 3.5% Silver (Ag) and is often written as Sn96.5Ag3.5. Sn96.5Ag3.5 Eutectic Leadfree Solder Spheres are not as common as the 4% silver alloy, but are sometimes used due to the eutectic melting temperature of 221&deg;C (the 4% version does not have a eutectic temperature). These lead-free solder balls are used by companies working with BGA, CSP, LBGA, PBGA and CBGA components who have made the transition to Lead-free (Pb-free) soldering. Features: Eutectic Melting Temperature of 221&deg;C (430&deg;F) High Silver solders have the Highest Joint Reliability Compatible with all Flux Types Best Wetting Sn/Ag/Cu Alloy Each jar has a clear label on the lid specifying the solder ball diameter as well as a label on the front identifying the alloy type, the quantity of spheres in the jar, the date of manufacture, and the product lot (or batch) number. This batch number is also tied to a certificate of conformance that is also provided with the solder spheres and ensures the Sn96.5Ag3.5 solder spheres meet the following quality criteria: Tin (Sn): 96.5% Silver (Ag): 3.5% Eutectic Melting Temperature: 221&deg;C Sphericity : Within 1.5% Diameter Tolerance 0.1mm - 0.25mm (100&micro;m - 250&micro;m) : &plusmn; 0.0050mm (&plusmn; 5&micro;m) 0.3mm - 0.45mm (300&micro;m - 450&micro;m) : &plusmn; 0.010mm (&plusmn; 10&micro;m) 0.5mm - 0.89mm (500&micro;m - 890&micro;m) : &plusmn; 0.020mm ( &plusmn; 20&micro;m)"

### What do I get when I buy Sn96.5Ag3.5 Eutectic Solder Spheres from CAPLINQ?

The advantage of ordering solder spheres online at CAPLINQ.com is that you can be sure of the quality. The solder spheres you receive are originally manufactured solder spheres packed into jars with inert gas (nitrogen). We do not repack the solder balls we receive, so the jars you will receive have never been opened, thus ensuring the quality of the product you receive. The lid of the jar is also always sealed with a shrink-wrapped plastic wrap ensuring that the solder spheres do not oxidate in the jar.
