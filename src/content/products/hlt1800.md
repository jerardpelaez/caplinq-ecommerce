shortDescription: Honeywell HLT1800 is two-part, dispensable thermal gap filler with low viscosity and good thixotropy properties. HLT1800 is formulated to balance thermal performance, phase separation and dispensing property. With its high compressibility, it is designed to minimize thermal resistance at interfaces and maintain excellent performance through reliability testing. It is typically used to cool capacitors and other packaged chips within IGBT modules that are conveniently preprinted with PTM7950. Honeywell HLT1800 exhibits excellent surface wetting and good dispensing and thixotropy properties for automated assembly processes. It offers low density, high compressibility for low-stress applications and proven long term reliability. The minimum bond line thickness it can reach is 0.2mm The product can be cured at either 18 hours at Room temperature or 30 minutes at 120°C. Of course those are just indications and you can experiment with curing for your application needs.
