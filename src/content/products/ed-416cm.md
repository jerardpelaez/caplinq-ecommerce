Directions for Use



- The adhesive should be applied on clean surface that is free of dirt, grease, or mold release. In the case that it is coated with such, a simple solvent wipe will suffice.

- Mix thoroughly by weight (1:1 mix ratio) prior to use.

- After mixing the two parts, the adhesive should be used within its pot life. Large quantity mixing is not recommended for this product.

- For maximum bonding strength, apply the adhesive evenly to both surfaces that will be joined together.

- For handling information, refer to the attached Technical Data Sheet
