shortDescription: "LINQSOL BCP-1522 is a thermosetting coating powder designed for low to medium-voltage busbar and switchgear applications. Once cured, BCP-1522 forms a smooth, durable, and moisture-resistant coating, suitable for operations up to 38 KV. The powder allows for fast and significant coating buildup, which speeds up production cycles. It can be used effectively on both copper and aluminum busbars, creating coatings that are over 200 mil (5 mm) thick. LINQSOL BCP-1522 also boasts a high UL746B Relative Thermal Index (130 °C), ensuring reliable performance even under elevated temperatures. Its fine particle size (44–210 µm), which is optimized for fluidized bed coating systems, promotes uniform application and consistent coating quality. Advantages of BCP-1522 for Busbar Coating Suitable for copper and aluminum bar Smooth, uniform coating build in excess of 200 mils (5 mm) Rapid build rates to reduce cycle times Fine grind powder to replenish size distribution Fluidizing agent to promote uniform build Ongoing testing to optimize quality & productivity Typical applications and uses of BCP-1522 include: Low Voltage (600V) Copper, Aluminum and Brass Busbars Medium Voltage (up to 38kV) Copper, Aluminum and Brass Busbars Switchgear Equipment for Power Distribution Recommended coating Temperature: 170 – 220 °C. (170 °C x 20 min or 210 °C x 5 min )"
