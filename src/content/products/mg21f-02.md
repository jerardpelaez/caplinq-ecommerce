shortDescription: Hysol MG21F-02 is a high productivity, low cost, epoxy molding compound, designed specifically for high volume encapsulation of low voltage diodes and small signal transistors. It offers excellent reliability & HTRB data and has been used for diode bridge, axial diodes, diode metal electrode leadlesss face (MELF) and other high voltage and discrete semiconductor packages. It offers excellent adhesion to Sn, Si and Cu and amazing HTRB performance. Hysol MG21F-02 performs very well during high-temperature reverse bias testing for devices running up to 800V and at 150°C. The largest cause of failure of epoxy molding compounds on these devices is the result of gate leakage and then ultimately catastrophic run-away current when tested under bias at temperature. MG21F-02 performs very well under these conditions. The CTI (comparative tracking index) of the MG-21F-02 is 325V. Hysol MG21F-02 was developed many years ago, but is still one of the best EMC on the market for diodes, bridges and high voltage diodes. Many competitors have tried and failed to compete against this MG21F-02. Those that did manage to meet the same performance targets as the MG21F-02 did so at prices that were nearly twice that of the MG21F-02, leaving this product leading with an excellent price/performance correlation. Typical applications and uses of MG21F-02 include but are not limited to 28, 28 and 56 pin DL TSSOP, SOT, SOIC, PDIP and other power discrete and high voltage semiconductor packages. We are currently developing the Green version of this product, to ensure it does not contain TBBP-A or antimony trioxide while also maintaining its flame retardant and electrically stable properties.
