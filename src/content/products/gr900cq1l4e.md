shortDescription: Hysol GR900C Q1L4E is a low filler cut version of Q1L4. Filler cut size is 53um instead of 75um so it flows much better. This product was initially destined to be an E version of GR900 Q1L4 but it ended up having it's own product code as GR900C. Q1L4E is added for completion and to avoid misunderstandings. Don't ask. It is a black semiconductor-grade epoxy molding compound designed for the encapsulation and protection of quad-flat no-leads (QFN) and dual-flat no-leads (DFN). Hysol GR900C Q1L4E is a spherical silica filled (86.5%) high end epoxy, typically used for QFN and DFN packages. It is mostly destined for larger package sizes between 5x5 and 7x7 QFN. This product is formulated to have a very low internal stress to reduce warpage, as well as low moisture absorption to increase MSL performance to MSL 1 @260°C with 3x reflow. Hysol GR900C Q1L4E is an environmentally "green" halogen free product, meaning that it doesn't contain any bromine, antimony or phosphorus flame retardants. Previous MG-series EMC dominated the space for power semiconductors but used halogen-containing flame retardants. This next generation epoxy mold compound replaces these older generation products. To add to that, this material is designed to achieve JEDEC Level 1 requirements at 260°C reflow temperature on preplated or NiPdAu leadframes. It meets UL 94 V-0 Flammability at 1/8 inch (3.18mm) thickness.
