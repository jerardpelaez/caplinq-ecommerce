Directions for Use



- Thaw the adhesive at 2-13℃ for 1 hour then place it at 14-34℃ for 1 to 1.5 hours. Do not open or loosen the syringe cover before the product is done thawing.

- Clean and dry the surface of the substrate before applying EO-322PL.

- Apply the adhesive to either one piece or both pieces that need to be joined together. Ensure that both parts are in contact with each other as the adhesive is curing.

- Curing time varies depending on the geometry, substrates to be joined together, bondline thickness, and efficiency of the oven. Ensure that the cure schedule is in accordance with the actual production parts and equipment.




Storage and Handling


Store the sealed container at –20 °C to –5°C, away from moisture and heat. When unopened and stored properly, the shelf life is 181 days (about 6 months). Avoid keeping the product at 14 °C to 34 °C for too long, as this may affect its performance.
