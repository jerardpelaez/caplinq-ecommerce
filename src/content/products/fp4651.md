apiId: 2425
name: LOCTITE ECCOBOND FP4651
slug: fp4651
sku: FP4651
brand: CAPLINQ
category: liquid-encapsulants
subcategory: liquid-encapsulants
sellingPoints:
  - Excellent chemical resistance
  - Low thermal expansion
  - Alternative to FP4654
shortDescription: LOCTITE® ECCOBOND FP4651 epoxy encapsulant features very low thermal expansion while retaining syringe dispense capabilities. Its low viscosity and 50 micron maximum particle size (Avg 7um) gives it improved handling properties over FP4650 for fine wire pitch and cavity-fill applications. It is based on FP4450 resin chemistry, therefore exhibiting excellent chemical resistance and thermal stability properties. With such a high filler rate(82% with 50um max filler size), low CTE and warpage it is essentially a liquid molding compound. LOCTITE® ECCOBOND FP4651 is a top candidate for a drop in replacement of FP4654 that is slowly being phased out. Even though its viscosity is relatively higher, it is still well within the realms of jetting and dispensing so with the right amount of adjustments to surface and needle heat (and even without them) it should work great as an alternative solution.

### Why are there some gelling differences between FP4651 and FP4654?


Looking at the FP 4651 un-cured properties vs "good old FP 4654" we see some differences which could be related to the "gelling" of FP 4651"



- FP 4651 has a shorter work life at 25°C (time to double viscosity) than FP 4654 (2 vs 3 days)

- FP 4651 has a shorter GEL time at 121°C than FP 4654 (9 vs 11 minutes)

- FP 4651 has a higher silica filler loading (82 vs 80%) and consequently higher base viscosity than FP 4654




This means FP 4651 can have a certain (and smaller) viscosity range for your application and the equipment than FP 4654. A work life of 2 days of FP 4651 still looks nice on paper, but we assume that doubling of such a high(er) viscosity would not fit some well-defined and tight processes.


Heating up the needle to 40C can help to reduce the viscosity, but will also speed up the gelling.
