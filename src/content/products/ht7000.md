What properties of HT7000 will be greatly impacted when use beyond the expiration date?


Using HT7000 beyond its expiration date can significantly impact its properties. Thermal hybrid gels, such as HT7000, tend to be more sensitive to aging compared to phase change materials. While oil separation is a common concern, it is not the sole issue that may arise with expired thermal gels. Specifically, for HT7000, a noticeable drop in flow rate has been observed, which can negatively affect the customer's production line.


If a customer intends to use expired material, it is strongly recommended to conduct thorough quality testing to assess its suitability before proceeding.
