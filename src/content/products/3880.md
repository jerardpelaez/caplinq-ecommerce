shortDescription: "LOCTITE ABLESTIK 3880 is designed for bonding of metals, ceramics, rubbers and plastics as used in electronic parts, where good adhesion combined with electrical and thermal conductivity is required. Typical applications include bonding surface mount devices to flexible or rigid substrates, bonding of semiconductor elements, joining EMI parts, bonding electrodes, lead wires or other connectors that require conductivity. LOCTITE ABLESTIK 3880 is a monocomponent, thermally and electrically conductive adhesive that can be used to mount electronic components via syringe and stencil print. Cure Schedule: 10 minutes @ 125°C 6 minutes @ 150°C 3 minutes @ 175 °C"
