shortDescription: "LINQTAPE PET1S is a 1-mil polyester film backing with a pressure sensitive silicone adhesive system. PET1S polyester tape is a no-residue tape designed for splicing and masking applications where high initial adhesion is required, but no residue once the tape is removed. LINQTAPE PET1S is a high performance, flexible, polyester tape used in a wide range of applications. For very high temperature applications, polyimide tape should be used, but for applications with temperatures up to 180C, PET1S is the most effective and least expensive solution. Key Features: No residue High initial adhesion For splicing and masking High performance Flexible"
