- Aerospace systems (e.g., avionics, control modules)

- Automotive electronics (e.g., engine control units, sensors)

- Industrial automation (e.g., motor drives, PLCs)

- Consumer electronics (e.g., smartphones, gaming devices)






### Why choose HumiSeal® 1B15 over other conformal coatings?




HumiSeal® 1B15 is easy to use and provides excellent protection. It provides excellent electrical insulation, fluoresces under UV for easy inspection, and is easily repairable. It is also compliant with MIL-I-46058C and 2002/95/EC, making it a trusted choice for demanding applications. You can learn how to select a conformal coating in our latest blog.






### What is the shelf life of HumiSeal® 1B15?


HumiSeal® 1B15 has a shelf life of 18 months from the date of manufacture when stored at room temperature (0 to 35°C) in tightly closed containers. Prior to use, allow the product to equilibrate for 24 hours at 18 to 32°C to ensure optimal performance.




### How should I clean tools after applying HumiSeal® 1B15?


Tools and equipment used for applying HumiSeal® 1B15 (e.g., spray guns, brushes, or dipping tanks) can be cleaned using HumiSeal® Thinner 503 & 521. For removing the coating from PCBs during rework, use HumiSeal® Stripper 1080 or 1080A. Always use a lint-free cloth and ensure proper ventilation during cleaning.






### What happens to HumiSeal® 1B15 after its shelf life?


Past its 18-month shelf life, HumiSeal® 1B15 may experience changes in viscosity, which could affect application consistency and coating uniformity. Using expired product may lead to suboptimal performance, and the manufacturer will not be liable for quality or performance issues if expired material is used.




### Why do curing times vary for HumiSeal® 1B15?


HumiSeal® 1B15 is a moisture-curing coating. Curing times vary depending on temperature, humidity, and film thickness. Typically, the coating will be tack-free in approximately 10 minutes and fully cured in 7days.






### What is the recommended thickness for HumiSeal® 1B15?


The recommended coating thickness for HumiSeal® 1B15 is 25 to 75 microns. This range ensures optimal protection without compromising flexibility or electrical performance. The thickness can be adjusted by controlling viscosity with HumiSeal® Thinner 503/Thinner 521 during application.




### What are the differences between application methods for HumiSeal® 1B15?


HumiSeal® 1B15 can be applied via spraying, dipping, or brushing. Spraying and dipping are ideal for large-scale production, while brushing is suited for small repairs. Each method requires adjusting viscosity with the appropriate thinner for a uniform coating.






### What is the maximum operating temperature for HumiSeal® 1B15?


HumiSeal® 1B15 can withstand thermal shock from –65°C to +125°C. It is not recommended for continuous operation above 125°C, as prolonged exposure to higher temperatures may degrade its protective properties.




### What safety precautions should I take when using HumiSeal® 1B15?


The solvents in HumiSeal® 1B15 are flammable, so avoid open flames or sparks during application. Use in a well-ventilated area to prevent inhalation of vapors or spray mist, and avoid skin and eye contact. Always consult the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) prior to use for detailed safety guidelines.






### How can I ensure proper application of HumiSeal® 1B15?


HumiSeal® 1B15 fluoresces under UV light, allowing for easy inspection of coating coverage. After application, use a UV light source to check for uniform coating and ensure there are no missed areas, which is critical for high-reliability electronics manufacturing.
