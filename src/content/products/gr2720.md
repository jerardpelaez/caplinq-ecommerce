sellingPoints:
  - For conductive polymer and AO capacitors
  - Excellent thin wall crack resistance
  - Fast cure for automold equipment
shortDescription: Hysol GR2720 is a low stress, black semiconductor-grade epoxy molding compound designed for the encapsulation and protection of Conductive Polymer Capacitors and Aluminum Organic (AO) capacitors. Polymer conductive capacitors and Aluminum Organic capacitors offer very high capacitance in a very small size. Epoxy molding compounds designed for these packages must have very low stress and very good thin wall crack resistance. This is the only way to be able to pass the MSL performance on these package types. GR2720 excels in both fields and has both low stress and excellent thin wall crack resistance. Hysol GR2720 is a laser markable, environmentally free, halogen free "green" product, meaning that it doesn't contain any halogens including bromine, antimony or phosphorus flame retardants. This material is designed to achieve JEDEC Level 1 requirements at 260°C reflow temperature on Aluminum Organic (AO) capacitors as well as conductive polymer capacitors. Its fast cure time also ensures that it is compatible with the latest automold manufacturing equipment. Hysol GR2720 meets UL 94 V-0 Flammability at 1/4 inch (6.35mm) thickness.
