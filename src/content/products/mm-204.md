shortDescription: "MM-204 dicyclopentadiene acrylate is a mono-functional acrylate monomer. It has low shrinkage and a high glass transition temperature upon cure. The secondary ester linkage is resistant to hydrolysis. MM-204 is recommended for use as a reactive diluent for UV or peroxide cured resins, coatings or adhesives. It can also be used to improve stereolithographic processes for high-temperature applications. Highlights Low viscosity Hydrolytically resistant High glass transition temperature Diluent for thermoset resins Low cure shrinkage High Tg Typical Physical and Chemical Properties PROPERTY METHOD RESULT Appearance at Room Temperature: Light tan liquid Viscosity @ 25°C (typical): 50 cPs using Haake Rheometer Functionality:1 Molecular Weight: 204 daltons Recommended Storage: At 5°C or below"
