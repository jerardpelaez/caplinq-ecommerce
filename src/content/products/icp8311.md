shortDescription: LOCTITE® ABLESTIK ICP 8311 is an electrically conductive adhesive designed for applications where a fast cure is required. It is ideally suited for high throughput photovoltaic dispense and print processes and applications where high adhesion strength is required. Low and stable contact resistance is achieved on substrates containing Sn during reliability testing. LOCTITE® ABLESTIK ICP 8311 is a flexible acrylate that is compatible with Sn (Tin). It is typically used for flexible interconnects in photovoltaic shingle applications. It is developed for solar panel applications with max 25um filler cut and DSC onset temperature of 60° Celsius, suitable for high volume jet dispensing, screen printing and stencil printing processes. Cure Schedule 10 - 15 seconds @ 150°C
