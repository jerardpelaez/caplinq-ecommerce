shortDescription: LOCTITE ABLESTIK 561 is designed for bonding materials with mismatched coefficients of thermal expansion. In many bonding applications, components may be repaired. This thermally conductive epoxy film is typically used for Assembly applications. LOCTITE ABLESTIK 561 is reworkable, meaning that components glued with this adhesive can be debonded by heating the assembly to 150°C and sliding a thin blade, such as a razor blade, between the bonded surfaces. This adhesive is also available in a low temperature cure version. Cure Schedule 30min @150°C 2 hours @ 125°C
