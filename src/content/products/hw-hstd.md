shortDescription: Honeywell HW-HSTD heat spreaders are used to dissipate heat from the chip. Heat spreaders can be produced in two different ways, by progressive stamping, and by transfer die stamping. Transfer Die stamped lids (heat spreaders) can be produced in a wide range of form factors. The maximum size of lids made with transfer die-stamping is 130 x 130mm. Heat spreaders are plated with Nickel (Ni) and can also be plated with Gold (Au) with selective spot plating on order to comply with the 24K /Mil spec. Transfer die stamped heat spreaders are made with Transfer die stamping and enable complex part designs and allow high-volume - continuous processes, they are ideal for mass-scale, complex production. If you would require less volumes then it probably would make sense to invest in progressive stamped heat spreaders.
