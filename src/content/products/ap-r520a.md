shortDescription: KESTER R520A is a lead-free, organic acid, water-soluble solder paste formula specifically designed for use with the higher temperature Pb-Free alternative soldering alloys such as Sn96.5Ag3.0Cu0.5 (SAC Alloys). The solder paste exhibits long stencil life and tack time, while still delivering exceptional solderability to a wide variety of metallic substrates. R520A was formulated to release consistently from the stencil for those critical fine pitch applications (0.5 mm/20 mils) with anti-slump characteristics and preferred solder deposit definition. The activator package in this formula is extremely aggressive, providing superior wetting to OSP coated and Immersion Gold over Electroless Nickel (ENIG) boards. R520A is an extremely stable water-soluble formula. Product Key Features Lead-free & water-soluble Print speed up to 150mm/sec (6in/sec) Stable tack life to long stencil life Consistent printing Applications Stencil & enclosed head printing (89.5% metal)

### Reflow Profile

The recommended reflow profile for R520A made with SAC alloys is shown here. This profile is simply a guideline. Since R520A is a highly active solder paste, it can solder effectively over a wide range of profiles. Your optimal profile may be different from the one shown based on your oven, board, and mix of defects. Please contact us if you need additional profiling advice.
