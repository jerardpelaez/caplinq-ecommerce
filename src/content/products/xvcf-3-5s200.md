shortDescription: LINQSTAT XVCF-3.5S200 is a highly conductive conductive polyethylene film with a very high electrically conductive carbon loading and a very dense polymer mix. Using a premium polymer and a refined process, we are able to increase the conductivity and thus reduce the surface resistance of the plastic to as low as ±200 ohms/sq of surface resistance. This extra loading allows the film to be used in applications that require a lower resistivity. Volume resistivity, based on the thickness of the material is around 25 ohms-cm. XVCF-3.5S200 conductive films are thin (0.09mm or 3.5 mil), lightweight and relatively inert. Furthermore, they are well suited for applications requiring electrochemical reactions, high conductivity or charge storage including but not limited to electrodes (ECG, TENS, Defibrillation and Iontophoresis), batteries (flat-cell zinc/manganese dioxide (MnO2), Lithium Ion and Lithium polymer), wearable electronics and digital whiteboards. XVCF-3.5S200 film and its conductivity are unaffected by humidity and age. The film is heat sealable, flexible and offers exceptional abrasion resistance. The film gives good thermal stability and has outstanding chemical resistance. It has a standard thickness of 89µm (3.5 mil) and is available in various lengths and widths upon request. This is one of the most conductive plastic films in our entire product line. Additionally, the film has been proven to be highly UV resistant, absorbing UV radiation at 365 nm up to 100%. If you need lower resistivity the Polyethylene carbon loaded films have pretty much reached their limits. You might want to consider Polyurethane films that can go down to 10 ohms/sq.

Given its low surface resistance, LINQSTAT XVCF films have been successfully used as a pressure sensor making them useful for applications that require more conductivity to be able to detect more subtle pressure differences.


### Applications:



- ECG electrodes

- TENS electrodes

- Defibrillation electrodes

- Digital white boards

- Lithium ion / polymer battery

- Flat-cell MnO2 battery





Due to its low-resistivity and its resistance to a range of chemicals and alcohols, these films are suitable for use in electrodes. Their matte finish allows them to be printed on, and the low material thickness makes them flexible to adapt well to a range of contours.



### Chemical Susceptibility:



- Methanol: Resistant

- Ethanol: Resistant

- Isopropanol: Resistant

- Weak Acids: Resistant

- Ketones (Acetone): Slow Attack

- Weak Alkalines: Slow Attack

- Hydrocarbons: Non-Resistant




### Product Features & Benefits:



- Volume-conductive plastic

- Black Opaque - Printable

- Provides Anti-Static protection to electronics components

- Groundable

- Humidity independent conductivity

- Thin, Lightweight, Inert




These films have a higher carbon loading than our standard VCF-Series films. This higher carbon loading gives us a lower resistance and as such, a higher conductivity. We come to a physical limit on how much carbon this plastic can be loaded before other properties are adversely affected, and so to get even more conductivity, we need to go to a more dense polymer matrix as we have done with our XVCF-ALS series films. The result of this denser matrix is a higher conductivity and better mechanical properties.
