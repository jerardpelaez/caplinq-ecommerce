shortDescription: CAPLINQ Linqstat PIT1N-Alum Series is a high performance, high-temperature resistant aluminized polyimide film, formed by sputtering aluminum onto polyimide using an aluminum vacuum deposition method. This combination of materials allows that one side is an insulation side and the other is conductive. CAPLINQ Linqstat PIT1N-Alum Series combines these two materials to give a very heat resistant, mechanically and chemically stable, radiation-resistant, and self-extinguishing product that has very high thermal conductivity and EMI shielding. CAPLINQ Linqstat PIT1N-Alum Series is a used in a number of applications, including as a first surface mirror for multilayer insulation (MLI) blankets, EMI shielding, electromagnetic shielding tape and flexible etching wire.

### What is the transmittance of PIT1N-ALUM?


While we don't test for these values, in theory, the transmittance is the inverse of absorbance. So if you need an estimate value, this would be a good starting point.
