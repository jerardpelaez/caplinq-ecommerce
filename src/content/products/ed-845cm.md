Directions for Use



- Weigh the correct proportions and mix thoroughly, scraping both the bottom and the sides of the mixing container until a homogeneous mixture is obtained.



Ensure that the bonding surfaces are clean, dry, and properly prepared.




Use mixed product before pot life for optimum properties. Avoid large quantity mixing. Apply adhesive evenly to both surfaces for maximum bond strength.




Cure time depends on part geometry, materials, bond line thickness (recommended to be lower than 30 mm when used as potting), and oven efficiency. Confirm cure schedule with actual parts and equipment.
