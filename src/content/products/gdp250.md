shortDescription: "LINQCELL GDP250 is a 250-µm thick graphitized carbon fiber paper made from high-quality polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers. The fibers undergo a wet-laying process to form a non-woven, fibrous, and porous structure, which is then carbonized and graphitized at 1600 °C. This high-temperature graphitization results in high electrical conductivity, high oxidation resistance, and excellent thermal stability, making LINQCELL GDP250 highly recommended as gas diffusion layers in fuel cells. It can also be used as gas diffusion substrates for carbon dioxide electrolyzers. Key Features: High-Temperature Graphitization: Graphitized at an elevated temperature of 1600 °C, this carbon fiber paper has a highly-crystalline graphite-like structure, enhancing conductivity, thermal stability, and oxidation resistance for demanding applications. No MPL and PTFE Layer: Enables direct control of interfacial modifications for system-specific optimization in fuel cells and electrochemical devices. High Permeability Despite Thickness ≥200 µm: Maintains high permeability for efficient gas diffusion and water management. Highly Recommended As: Gas diffusion layers of fuel cells, particularly proton exchange membrane fuel cells Gas diffusion substrates of carbon dioxide electrolyzer electrodes Due to the absence of a microporous layer, LINQCELL GDP250 exhibits high permeability despite its thickness (≥200 µm). This makes it particularly well-suited for high-humidity fuel cell operation (≥60%) at temperatures between 50 and 80 °C. In medium humidity conditions (20 to 60%), LINQCELL GDP250 may perform effectively, but the temperature should be kept low (≤50 °C). Recommended For Fuel Cells Operating at: High humidity (≥60%) at temperatures between 50 to 80 °C Medium relative humidity (20 to 60%) at low temperatures ≤50 °C LINQCELL GDP250 can be customized to meet specific requirements. It can be coated with a 10 wt% PTFE layer and is also available in roll form."
