  - Identical to MG33F-0660
shortDescription: Hysol MG33F-0661 is a gold, semiconductor-grade epoxy molding compound or duroplast designed for the encapsulation and protection of tantalum capacitors. Because of its fast cure, it is also very well suited for the manufacture of reed relays. Hysol MG33F-0661 was formulated with a short gel time to make it useful for automolding tantalum capacitors and reed relays.It is an environmentally friendly "green" molding compound which contains no bromine, antimony or phosphorus flame retardant. MG33F-0661 molding compound was developed specifically for the encapsulation of tantalum capacitors in automold applications. MG33F-0661 meets UL 94 V-0 Flammability at 6.35mm thickness. You might be wondering, "But what's the difference between this one and MG33F-0660?" Short answer. Nothing. Back in the day, SKUs were not ideal so this is a customer specific SKU for the exact same product. Why is this here then? Maybe you ARE that customer looking for it. You are welcome.
