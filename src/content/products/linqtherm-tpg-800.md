## Product Description

LinQTherm TPG-800 is CAPLINQ's flagship high-performance thermal grease engineered for applications where superior heat transfer is critical. With a thermal conductivity of 8.0 W/mK, the TPG-800 significantly outperforms conventional thermal interface materials, making it ideal for high-power semiconductor devices, advanced LED modules, and power electronics assemblies that demand efficient thermal dissipation.

Formulated with a proprietary blend of thermally conductive ceramic fillers in a silicone matrix, the TPG-800 delivers excellent wetting and low thermal impedance across a wide bond line thickness range. Its carefully optimized rheology ensures easy dispensing via syringe or automated equipment while maintaining positional stability after application, even in vertical orientations.

The TPG-800 is designed for long-term reliability, exhibiting minimal oil bleed, pump-out resistance, and stable thermal performance over thousands of thermal cycles between -40 and 200 °C. It is RoHS compliant and halogen-free, meeting the stringent environmental requirements of the automotive and consumer electronics industries.

## Key Features
