shortDescription: "LINQTAPE PTFE2S-Series describes our 2-mil thick Skived PTFE Film with a silicone pressure-sensitive adhesive. PTFE2S-Series tapes are used for high-temperature applications. They have excellent acid resistance as well as alkali resistance and have very low surface friction, making them ideal for heating panels. These tapes provide an excellent balance of electrical, thermal, and chemical properties over a wide range of temperatures, and can be used in applications that may see temperatures up to 260°C (500°F) Further, PTFE2-Series have been used successfully to wrap high voltage wire in high-temperature operating conditions. Because of its Class H rating, it can be used in many electrical insulation applications. PTFE2S comes in 33-meter (36 yard) rolls of varying widths. LINQTAPE PTFE films with silicone adhesive are available in a range of thicknesses, starting from 2 mil (50.8µm) thickness and up. Custom thicknesses are available upon request. Key Features: Insulating tape Pressure-sensitive silicone adhesive High-temperature applications Excellent acid and alkali resistance Low surface friction Class H rating"
