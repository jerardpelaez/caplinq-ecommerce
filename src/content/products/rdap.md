  - For coatings that react with metal alkoxide functional groups
shortDescription: Aculon's RD-A is a nano-scale organometallic coating product that is capable of promoting adhesion across a broad spectrum of metal surfaces. It is quick and easy to apply and will eliminate adhesive failures. Aculon's RD-A adhesion primer can be applied via most traditional coating processes, including dipping, spraying, wiping, etc., and provides an optically clear, uniform coating thickness of 5-100 nm depending on the application. The Aculon RD-A surface treatment is designed to improve adhesion for coatings that react with metal alkoxide functional groups (e.g. silane/siloxanes, phosphonate/phosphates (acid forms), carboxylic acids, etc.). Advantages of Aculon's RD-A Improved adhesion strength of silicone paints/coatings on metal surfaces Excellent chemical bonding to many metal surfaces Does not out-gas No stress build-up on the substrates Does not change the appearance of the surface Treated surfaces are very stable (if stored in typical office/lab conditions) Easy to apply through standard wet coating methods such as dipping or spraying

### How to apply the Aculon RD-A






STEP 1 ⇨ CLEAN




STEP 2 ⇨ TREAT




STEP 3 ⇨ DRY










Parts must be sufficiently clean before treatment for proper bonding and effective application.


To clean, solvents or soap and water can be used to degrease the substrate.


Then, a cleaner is recommended to remove monolayer-scale contaminants.






Wipe - With the wipe, thoroughly apply pressure to the location where the adhesive weight is intended to be mounted. Wait at least 30 seconds, then wipe the when with a clean dry towel to remove any residue (critical step).






This product does not require a cure, however, in some cases and substrates a brief 5-minute cure at 60⁰C will benefit.








Spray - Spray the solution onto the substrate using double passes.






Dip - Fully immerse the part in the treatment solution for 10 seconds, then air dry in a clean space.






Dip with Sonification - Completely submerge the substrate in the solution and sonicate for 10 seconds. Then remove the substrate and allow it to air dry.










### Application Tips



- For spray application, post-application curing is recommended for best performance.

- Coat the substrate as soon as possible after cleaning to prevent recontamination.

- Spray Equipment Suggestions: HVLP(Binks Mach 1), HVLP(Devilbiss JGHV), Air Atomization(Devilbiss MBC gun), and Airless(Graco Model 225-292 President Pump Series A).

- Cure temperatures and conditions should be optimized based on substrate and durability requirements.

- Clean all equipment with alcohol (e.g., Isopropanol) or the solvent used.

- If a UV-curable coating system is being used, then it may be necessary to modify the curing parameters to ensure sufficient radical generation near the surface of the monolayer to achieve optimal adhesion.






### Application Ideas



- Use as a primer layer for organosiloxanes/organophosphonates

- Improved bonding of silane (high temperature) over-mold compound
