shortDescription: Honeywell HLT3500LV is a two-part, dispensable thermally conductive gel, which offers long-term reliability and superior softness. The enhanced bonding force between the polymer base and the filler largely improves the thermally conductive gel oil separation issue in storage. Prior to curing, the material maintains good thixotropic characteristics and low viscosity to be easily dispensed. The product can be cured in short time after two- component mixing at room temperature. The high compressibility minimizes thermal resistance at interfaces, while maintaining excellent performance during reliability testing. It is the Low Volatiles version of HLT 3500 with less than 50ppm on Σ D3-D20. Honeywell HLT3500LV is a balanced solution for Vertical mounting that requires high TC before we go into the upper end of the product line. The enhanced bonding force between the polymer base and the filler largely improves the thermally conductive gel oil separation issue in storage. Prior to curing, the material maintains good thixotropic characteristics and low viscosity to be easily dispensed. Cure Schedule 18 hours at Room temperature or 30minutes at 100°C. These are just indications. You can experiment with curing for your application needs.
