shortDescription: LINQBOND SMA3603 is a one-component epoxy designed for chip bonding. This resin has medium viscosity and high thixotropy. It cures at low temperatures and is suitable for screen printing and dispensing applications. The resin forms strong cured shapes without stringing or slumping, even at high-speed dispensing and with very small dots. The hardened surface does not exhibit surface oiliness. Once cured, LINQBOND SMA3603 offers good adhesive strength, electrical insulation properties, and excellent chemical and solvent resistance. Stable adhesive strength can be achieved with various SMT (Surface-Mount Technology) applications. This product is well-suited for electronic device encapsulation and chip bonding

Storage and Handling


Store and transport in a cool, dry place at temperatures from –20 to –5 °C. Before use, allow the resin to warm to 14 to 34 °C for 1–2 hours. Prolonged exposure to room temperature can alter the properties. The shelf life when stored from –20 to –5 °C is 183 days (6 months).
