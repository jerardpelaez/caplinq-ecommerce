shortDescription: "Short flow version of MH20-01 MH20-0686 is a very tough epoxy mold compound with excellent high temperature resistance. It is used in applications that use thermoset plastics instead of thermoplastics because of the high temperature requirements. MH20-0686 is UL94 V-0 listed and is used on devices that have a Class N rating. It is CTE matched to copper, CuSn6, and bronze. MH20-0686 is an industry-proven product, used to make power resistors, switches, sensors, and actuators. A long-flow version is available as MH20-01. An injection-moldable version is available as MH20-01 IM. Main Applications Power Resistors Molding Actuator Epoxy Encapsulation Thermoset plastic switches Product Features & Benefits: Perfect for power resistors, switches, and actuators High Tg for high operating temperature stability Long flow and short flow versions available CTE matched to copper, CuSn6, and bronze Very tough epoxy mold compound High Tg compound designed for higher temperature applications UL94 V-0 listed Used on Class N rated devices with an operating temperature up to 200°C For applications up to 220°C, MH20-0686 is a proven industry performer for power resistors, switches, fuses, power modules, and other high temperature applications requiring a high glass transition temperature."
