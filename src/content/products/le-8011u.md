To meet higher application requirements, liquid encapsulation is expected to have (1) excellent thermal stability; (2) low transmittance decay. Our resin technology could help meet these challenges. With the resin improved in LE-8011HT, the pot life increased (~7 hours), and viscosity decreased (~400-800 cP). LE-8011U is an optically clear encapsulation with superior anti-blue decay and thermal aging stability.




### OPTOLINQ LE-8011HT | Visible Light Blocking


LE-8011HT is developed based on LE-8011U, thus LE-8011HT keeps UV-blocking properties as LE-8011U.

Processing Instructions



- Mix components A and B in a 100:95 weight ratio and stir uniformly. Ensure that the mixture is uniform and free from streaks or unevenness.

- Defoam the mixture under vacuum conditions for 5 minutes.

- Recommended curing condition: First cure at 130 °C for 1 hour, then post-cure at 150 °C for 4 hours.




The curing conditions provided are recommended guidelines based on typical laboratory results. Actual curing parameters should be defined and validated by the user to ensure compatibility with specific materials, part geometries, and end-use requirements. It is the user’s responsibility to optimize and confirm curing conditions that meet their performance and quality standards.




Storage and Handling


The uncured resin can be cleaned with acetone or a suitable cleaning agent. Water cannot be used as cleaning agent. Store in a cold, dry, and clean environment between 10–30 °C with relative humidity below 70%. Keep away from exposure to direct sunlight. It is strictly forbidden to store in outdoor environments. At proper storage conditions, unopened Part A and Part B have a shelf life of 12 months.
