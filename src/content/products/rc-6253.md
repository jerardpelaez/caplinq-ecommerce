shortDescription: LINQCOAT RC-6253 is a solvent-free epoxy resin engineered for use as an impregnation and protective coating material for electronics assemblies. Once cured, it forms a high-gloss, Shore-D 87 network that delivers >25 kV mm⁻¹ dielectric strength, resists moisture uptake (0.1 %), and retains mechanical integrity from −20 to 180 °C. LINQCOAT RC-6253 offers a combination of electrical insulation, corrosion protection, and weather resistance, making it a robust, high-performance material for motors, sensors, and outdoor electronics operating in harsh environments. It also meets the requirements of the 2011/65/EU RoHS directive. Product Key Features High Glass Transition Temperature (140 °C) — Maintains its hard, glassy state and structural integrity at elevated temperatures. 14-day Pot Life — Provides extended working time, allowing for easier application, especially for larger or more complex assemblies High Dielectric Strength (>25 kV mm⁻¹) — Superior electrical insulation. Excellent Moisture Resistance — Absorbs only 0.1% moisture, protecting components from humidity. Applications Provides robust protection and electrical insulation in demanding motor applications. Ensures high-performance and longevity for electronics operating in harsh outdoor environments, including those exposed to wide temperature swings and moisture.

Directions for Use



- LINQCOAT RC-6253 can be applied by dipping, brushing, or other standard coating techniques.

- LINQCOAT RC-6253 should be stored at 2–13 °C. Before use, keep the sealed container at ambient conditions for 1–2 hours. Do not open the lid until the temperature has equalised to prevent moisture condensation.

- Ensure that the surfaces where RC-6253 will be applied are clean, dry, and free of grease, dust, and mold-release agents. A simple solvent wipe is usually sufficient.

- Use the product before pot life for optimum properties. Avoid large quantity dispensing without using.

- Reseal the container immediately after dispensing to minimise moisture uptake and maintain product performance.

- Wear appropriate protective equipment and minimize direct contact with the human body. Refer to the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) before use.
