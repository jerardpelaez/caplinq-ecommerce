## Frequently Asked Questions About HumiSeal® 1A68



### What are typical applications for HumiSeal® 1A68?




HumiSeal® 1A68 is a single-component, polyurethane conformal coating designed to protect printed circuit board assemblies (PCBs) in demanding environments. Its excellent moisture and chemical resistance, along with its wide operating temperature range, make it a reliable choice for a variety of industries, including:



- General printed circuit board applications

- Industrial electronics

- Automotive electronics

- Instrumentation and monitoring equipment




This coating is particularly well-suited for applications where reliable environmental protection is required and where a fast-drying, solvent-based system is preferred.




### Why choose HumiSeal® 1A68 over other conformal coatings?




HumiSeal® 1A68 is a single-component, high-performance polyurethane formulation that is fast-drying. It provides excellent chemical and moisture resistance. It contains no free isocyanates, making it a safer option. The coating is a flexible film with good abrasion resistance, and its viscosity is optimized for spray, brush, or dip application. The coating is compliant with IPC-CC-830, and it meets the requirements of the RoHS Directive 2002/95/EC and is recognized under UL File Number E105698.






### What is the shelf life of HumiSeal® 1A68?


HumiSeal® 1A68 has a shelf life of 24 months from the date of manufacture when stored at room temperature (18 to 32°C or 65 to 90°F) in a tightly closed container, away from excessive heat or direct sunlight. As it is a solvent-based material, it is crucial to protect the product from ambient air to prevent premature viscosity increase due to solvent evaporation. Therefore, any open or partial containers should be tightly sealed after use.




### How should I clean tools after applying HumiSeal® 1A68?


To flush equipment and clean uncured HumiSeal® 1A68, xylene or toluene are suitable solvents. For coating removal during rework, the cured film can be difficult to remove. Thermal displacement, mechanical abrasion, and specialized chemical strippers (e.g., HumiSeal® Stripper 1063) are all suitable options for rework.






### What happens to HumiSeal® 1A68 after its shelf life?


After the shelf life, the material's viscosity may increase due to solvent evaporation, which can lead to improper application, uneven coating, and a reduction in the protective performance of the cured film. The use of expired material is not recommended as it may compromise the quality and reliability of the coating. Due to its solvent-based nature, proper storage is critical to maintaining product integrity.




### How does HumiSeal® 1A68 cure, and why do curing times vary?


HumiSeal® 1A68 is a single-cure, solvent-drying coating that cures by the evaporation of its solvents to form a durable film. The coating has a dry to handle time of 15 minutes at room temperature, and will reach its optimum properties within 30 days. Curing times can vary based on ambient conditions; higher temperature and air flow will accelerate the curing process. Ensuring a well-ventilated and controlled environment is key for a consistent and reliable cure.






### What is the recommended thickness for HumiSeal® 1A68?


The recommended coating thickness for HumiSeal® 1A68 is 25 to 75 microns (1-3 mils). This thickness range ensures optimal protective performance while maintaining flexibility and electrical properties. The final thickness can be adjusted based on the application method and specific project requirements.




### What are the differences between application methods for HumiSeal® 1A68?


HumiSeal® 1A68 can be applied by dipping, spraying, or brushing. Dipping is often used for high-volume, automated processes, providing uniform coverage for complex geometries. Spraying, using conventional spray equipment, is ideal for selective application and achieving a consistent film. Brushing is suitable for rework or small-scale applications, offering precise control in localized areas. For all methods, ensuring a well-ventilated area is crucial to prevent the build-up of flammable solvent vapors.






### What is the maximum operating temperature for HumiSeal® 1A68?


HumiSeal® 1A68 has a continuous use operating temperature range of –65°C to +125°C, providing consistent protection across a wide range of thermal conditions. It is capable of withstanding thermal shock within this range.




### What safety precautions should I take when using HumiSeal® 1A68?


HumiSeal® 1A68 contains flammable solvents, so it should be used in well-ventilated areas and kept away from open flames or sparks. Prevent skin and eye contact by wearing appropriate personal protective equipment, including safety glasses and solvent-resistant gloves. Avoid inhalation of vapors and spray mist. Always consult the product's Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for detailed handling, storage, and disposal information.






### How can I ensure proper application of HumiSeal® 1A68?


HumiSeal® 1A68 contains a UV fluorescent tracer, which makes it easy to inspect for proper coverage. Under a UV lamp, the coating will fluoresce, allowing visual confirmation of uniform application and film integrity. This feature is essential for quality control and process monitoring, ensuring all required areas of the PCB have been coated uniformly. Test coupons can be used to periodically check thickness and cure quality.




### How does HumiSeal® 1A68 perform in harsh environments?


HumiSeal® 1A68 provides excellent protection against moisture, humidity, and chemical exposure. The cured polyurethane film is tough and flexible, ensuring long-term integrity against environmental stressors. This makes it an ideal solution for applications where PCBs are exposed to corrosive agents, moisture, or significant temperature fluctuations, such as in military or industrial settings.
