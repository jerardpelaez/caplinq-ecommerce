### Processing Instructions



- Mix Parts A and B in a 1:4 weight ratio. Ensure that the mixture is uniform and free from streaks or unevenness.

- If air bubbles are entrapped during mixing, degas the mixture under vacuum.

- Typical curing conditions: First cure at 125 °C for 5 min, followed by post cure at 150 °C for 180 min.




### Precautions



- Addition-cure materials may be susceptible to inhibition by certain substances, including organotin and other organometallic compounds, silicone rubber with organotin catalyst, sulfur-containing materials such as polysulfones, amines, urethanes, amine-containing materials, unsaturated hydrocarbon plasticizers, and some solder flux residues. Always exercise caution and conduct thorough compatibility testing when encountering materials or chemicals of concern in your specific application to prevent potential curing issues.

- Avoid skin and eye contact. In case of contact, rinse thoroughly with soap (for skin) or clean water (for eyes), and seek medical attention if needed.

- Maintain a clean and ventilated workplace, using extraction trunks when necessary.

- Wear appropriate protective equipment and minimize direct contact with the human body. Refer to the Material Safety Data Sheet (SDS) before use.




### Cleaning


Uncured silicone can be easily removed using common hydrocarbon solvents, such as toluene and hexane. Polar solvents, including water and alcohols, are not recommended for this application.


### Storage and Handling


Store in a ventilated, dry, and clean environment below 25°C. Do not allow moisture to come into contact with these materials. Containers should always remain tightly sealed. n the case of partially filled containers, it is recommended to purge them with dry air or inert gases like nitrogen to maintain product integrity. At proper storage conditions, Part A and B have a shelf life of 6 months.
