shortDescription: CHEMLINQ WS810 Wax Conditioning Sheets are used to protect the mold surface and ensure a good releasing effect after cleaning. It is a waxing sheet that provides an ideal balance between great mold protection and high workability and it can be used for Green and non Green EMC as well as manual and auto molding processes. CHEMLINQ WS810 performs well in a wide range of molds and has a curing time of ~ 180-240 seconds. These sheets are highly effective as a protection and release product. They have good flow characteristics which enable them to easily reach into the mold corners and thin gate areas. Used in combination with our RCS Rubber Cleaning Sheets, the short mold waxing and cleaning time will lead to reduced costs and will increase your overall efficiency and productivity.
