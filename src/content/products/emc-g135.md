shortDescription: "LINQSOL EMC-G135 is a green epoxy molding compound specifically developed for rectifier bridges (GBU, KBJ, GBS and etc.) and SMX packages. It offers good moldability and low modulus to meeting low-stress requirements. With a thermal conductivity of ~1.7W/m⋅K, it satisfies the heat dissipation required by high-performing packages. G135 boasts of its high-cost effectiveness and excellent workability with more than 500 continuous mold shots. LINQSOL EMC-G135 guarantees strong performance and outstanding reliability. This product is deliberately formulated without the inclusion of substances prohibited by the European Union RoHS and REACH. Overall, LINQSOLTM EMC-G135 seamlessly integrates advanced material properties, safety compliance, and superior performance to deliver a reliable solution for semiconductor device encapsulation. Key Features ~1.7 W/m·K thermal conductivity — Enhances heat spreading in high-current bridge rectifiers. Low modulus (~16 GPa) — Reduces package stress and risk of crack/warp during cycling. High moldability (spiral flow ~88 cm) — Fills complex cavities cleanly; supports small gates and long runners. 500+ continuous shots — Stable release and low bleed for fewer interruptions and lower scrap. Electrical cleanliness (Cl⁻ ~9 ppm, Na⁺ ~4 ppm) — Minimizes ionic pathways that can lead to leakage or corrosion. Low moisture uptake (~0.45% PCT 24 h) — Helps maintain insulation and dimensional stability. UL-94 V-0 flammability — Meets stringent safety requirements for power electronics. RoHS/REACH compliant — Free from substances of concern for global market access. Reliability Tests Passed: HTRB, Tₐ=125°C, V=80%VR * 500 hour PCT, Tₐ=121°C, P=0.215atm, RH=100%* 98 hours Thermal Cycling Test, -55°C - +150°C * 500 cycles Application/Suitable For: Bridge rectifier packages: GBU, KBJ, GBS; SMX packages AC/DC power supplies, chargers, UPS rectifier stages Motor drives and industrial controls (bridge diode modules) General power conversion, where thermal conductivity and low package stress are critical"
