Blends of LOCTITE NCI 7002 E&C and LOCTITE ECI 7004HR E&C and LOCTITE ECI 7004LR E&C can be dried in conventional air circulated ovens. Higher temperatures will shorten the drying time and will lead to more stable resistance values.


For high speed production, jet drying, infra-red drying and drying in high speed reel-to-reel equipment can be used. The above cure profile is a guideline recommendation. Cure conditions (time and temperature) may vary based on customers' experience and their application requirements, as well as customer curing equipment, oven loading and actual oven temperatures.
