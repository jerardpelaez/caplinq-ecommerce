shortDescription: "ALPHA CVP-390V is a lead-free, no-clean solder paste designed to maximize flexibility in manufacturing processes, and provides excellent electrochemical reliability under extreme operating conditions. It exhibits consistent print and reflow performance across a wide range of component types. ALPHA CVP-390V exhibits >2.00CpK for transfer efficiencies between 60% to 120% area ratios above 0.60 against variable print process conditions. It also maintains repeatable transfer efficiency on fine feature 01005 components and excellent coalescence down to 170um circle and square apertures. ALPHA CVP-390V exhibits best-in-class electrochemical reliability down to 0.100mm comb spacing against the most challenging SIR profiles, making it ideal for applications requiring high reliability. Product Key Features: Superior electrochemical reliability Wide process window Excellent reflow and coalescence Note: Reading the technical data sheet (TDS) prior to use is highly recommended."
