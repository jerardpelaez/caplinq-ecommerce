shortDescription: "LINQTAPE PET2S is a 2-mil polyester film backing with a pressure sensitive silicone adhesive system. PET2S polyester tape is a no/low residue tape designed for splicing and masking applications where high initial adhesion is required, but no residue once the tape is removed. LINQTAPE™ PET2S Series is a high performance, flexible, high temperature resistant polyester tape used in many high temperature applications. For very high temperature applications, polyimide tape should be used, but for applications with temperatures up to 205°C (400°F), PET2S can be used. These applications include but are not limited to photosplicing, powder coating, anodizing, e-coating and other high temperature masking applications. Key Features: No residue High initial adhesion For splicing and masking High performance Flexible"
