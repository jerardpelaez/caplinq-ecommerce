shortDescription: LINQSOL™ EMC-G208 is a halogen-free epoxy molding compound engineered for micro SD cards and other thin, high-density packages. Its high-filler, low-CTE matrix controls warpage, while a high glass-transition temperature of 185 °C secures thermal stability under aggressive reflow profiles. Excellent flow and low melt viscosity promote void-free transfer molding through long, narrow cavities. Superior flow enables >500 consecutive shots per mold and formulation meets UL 94 V-0 flammability for robust safety margins. EMC-G208 is designed to satisfy JEDEC MSL-3 reliability requirements and strict ionic cleanliness limits. LINQSOL™ EMC-G208 guarantees strong performance and outstanding long-term reliability in demanding environments. This product is deliberately formulated without the inclusion of substances prohibited by the European Union RoHS and REACH. Overall, EMC-G208 seamlessly integrates advanced material properties, safety compliance, and superior performance to deliver a reliable solution for semiconductor device encapsulation. LINQSOL EMC-G208 is available in custom pellet dimensions. Contact us for detailed specifications. Key Features Low CTE (11 ppm / °C) – Matches silicon to minimise thermo-mechanical stress. High Tg 185 °C – Stable mechanical properties through lead-free reflow profiles. Fast Gel Time (27 s @ 175 °C) – Supports high-throughput, short-cycle transfer moulding. Long Spiral-Flow (60 in / 152 cm) – Ensures complete cavity fill in multi-site Micro SD lead-frame moulds. Moisture Resistance (0.40 % @ PCT, 24 h) – Enables JEDEC Level 3 reliability. Halogen- & Sb-Free, UL 94 V-0 – Meets global environmental and safety regulations without restricted additives. Applications / Suitable For Micro SD / TF memory cards Other flash-memory modules (SD, MMC, eMMC) Thin, warpage-sensitive laminate or lead-frame packages Low-profile SiP cards and high-density storage devices Small-outline sensors or controllers requiring high Tg and low CTE
