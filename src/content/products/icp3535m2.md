shortDescription: "LOCTITE ABLESTIK ICP 3535M2 electrically conductive epoxy adhesive is designed for circuit assembly applications. It is specifically recommended for mounting lower cost tin (Sn) finished components onto the conductive trace terminations of printed circuit boards or co-fired ceramic circuitry. From a chemistry standpoint it is the best option for Sn and Ni non noble metal alloys. It offer stable contanct resistance with 100% Sn terminated components. It also has improved anti-corrosion technology over CE3103WLV and CE3104WXL. LOCTITE ABLESTIK ICP 3535M2 is designed for applications with small size components (0603, 0402) where no bleeding or wicking (absorbing liquid by capillary action) is tolerated. This rigid adhesive can be applied by stencil printing. It can also be dispensed but due to its viscosity it might require some optimization. Its operating temperature is -40 up to 175°C. Cure Schedule: 1 hour @ 150°C or 10 minutes @ 175°C"
