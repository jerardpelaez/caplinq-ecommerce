shortDescription: A-304 is a 4-META (Methacryloxyethyl trimellitic anhydride) that contains contains two functional groups facilitating a bridge between tooth and adhesives. Research has found that methacrylates with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups, like 4-META, enhance monomer penetration into dentin pretreated with 10% citric acid and 3% ferric chloride (10-3). Examinations revealed the formation of a transitional zone of resin-reinforced dentin, termed the hybrid layer. A-304 is a white powder/crystal reactive primer recommended for use in dental applications. It is not listed in the TSCA list.
