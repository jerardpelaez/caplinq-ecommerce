shortDescription: LINQPAK Foil is constructed from non-heat conducting materials, including plastic and specialized compounds. LINQPAK Foil halts heat transfer via conduction. The design incorporates bubbles filled with air, to prevent convective heat loss. As heat is absorbed, the trapped air expands but remains confined, preventing convective currents from dissipating thermal energy. This unique feature proves invaluable in dry ice storage, where Linqpak's expanded air bubbles occupy the space left by sublimated dry ice, impeding external air intrusion and reducing sublimation rates of the remaining dry ice. LINQPAK Foils interior surface has a reflective coating strategically positioned beneath the bubbles, counteracting radiated temperature loss by trapping warmth within the enclosed environment. The foil is applicable in various different applications, foremost in the application of thermal management. In dry ice storage, it extends shelf life by minimizing sublimation rates, ensuring prolonged preservation. When utilized alongside dry ice as a coolant in packaging, it enhances cooling efficiency.
