shortDescription: "LINQSOL EMC-9070 is a black semiconductor-grade epoxy molding compound designed for the encapsulation and protection of quad-flat no-leads (QFN) and dual-flat no-leads (DFN). Once molded and post-mold cured, this product provides optimum protection and reliability for these semiconductor devices. LINQSOL EMC-9070 is a spherical silica filled (89%) EMC, typically used for QFN and DFN packages. QFN and DFN packages are low-profile packages that are MAP molded. This means that the packages are molded together in one large mold and then separated by cutting through the entire package. Epoxy molding compounds made for these types of packages must have a low warpage, and EMC-9070 is no exception. This product is formulated to have very low internal stress to reduce warpage, as well as low moisture absorption to increase MSL performance. Key Features: JEDEC MSL 1 @260°C Low CTE (8ppm) and mold shrinkage (Low moisture absorption (0.33% after PCT 96hrs@121°C) Halogen-free (contains no br, Sb, P, etc.) REACH and RoHS compliant UL 94 V-0 Flammability Application: QFN and DFN Packages"
