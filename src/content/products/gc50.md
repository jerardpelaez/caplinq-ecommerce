shortDescription: LOCTITE GC 50 solder paste is a halogen free, no-clean, Pb-free solder paste specially designed to provide enhanced stability when used in jet dispensing and other dispensing applications. This SAC 305 alloy comes in T4 and T5 powders, with T5 being having a fine particle size distribution, making it ideal for small components. LOCTITE GC 50 provides long-term stability over a wide range of temperature conditions. It is stable in the ejector head for at least 1 week (up to 28°C/82°F) and remains suitable for use in time/pressure and auger pump dispensing systems. Its stable room temp sustainability, enables void-free packaging for improved process consistency and sustainability as well as excellent soldering performance in air or in nitrogen. LOCTITE GC 50 has good resistance to graping in demanding reflow profiles and achieves and IPC Class III in voiding performance. Its post reflow residues readily removed with electronics industry solvents and it is compatible with Pb-free printing pastes in a solder additive process, eliminating the need for step-stencil or preforms.
