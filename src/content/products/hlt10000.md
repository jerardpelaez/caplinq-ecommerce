shortDescription: Honeywell HLT 10000 High TC Hybrid TIM is a two-component, dispensable thermal gap filler, which offers the highest thermal conductivity of the entire product line and long-term reliability. This top of the line product is made for the most demanding and delicate applications in the market. It starts with a very low thickness and compresses just as easily, reaching its final thickness in a remarkable rate. It is also easy to dispense and rework, making it ideal for high volume manufacturing. To add to that, it offers reduced oil separation and doesn't exhibit pump out or cracking. Honeywell HLT 10000 has a thermal conductivity of 10 W/mK accompanied with high reliability and ease of dispense. It can be cured after two-component mixing and can be cured faster under higher temperature. Its high compressibility minimizes thermal resistance at interfaces, while maintaining excellent performance during reliability testing. To make a long story short, this is the best TIM in the market and among other, it can be used for demanding mm wafer antenna 5G applications. You probably noticed the lack of information and product properties. Since those are top notch products, we go to certain extends to protect Honeywell's IP and competitive advantages. A plethora of information, including additional data, images and samples are available once an NDA is in place. Contact us for more details.
