## Product Description

LinQTherm TPG-600 is a high-quality standard thermal grease designed for a broad range of thermal management applications where a balance between performance and cost is required. With a thermal conductivity of 6.0 W/mK, the TPG-600 provides reliable heat transfer performance that exceeds conventional thermal greases while remaining an economical choice for high-volume production environments.

The TPG-600 utilizes a blend of aluminum oxide and zinc oxide fillers suspended in a stable silicone carrier. Its smooth, non-gritty consistency allows for uniform application by screen printing, stencil, or syringe dispensing. The formulation is specifically tuned for excellent surface wetting, ensuring intimate contact with both the component and heat sink surfaces to minimize interfacial thermal resistance.

Designed for general-purpose use in consumer electronics, networking equipment, and industrial controls, the TPG-600 delivers consistent performance over an operating range of -40 to 180 °C. Like all CAPLINQ thermal interface materials, it is non-curing and allows for easy rework during product assembly and field service. The TPG-600 meets all applicable RoHS and REACH requirements.

## Key Features

- Reliable 6.0 W/mK thermal conductivity
- Cost-effective formulation for high-volume production
- Smooth consistency for easy dispensing and screen printing
- Excellent surface wetting for low interfacial resistance
- Non-curing for easy rework and disassembly
- Wide operating temperature range: -40 to 180 °C
