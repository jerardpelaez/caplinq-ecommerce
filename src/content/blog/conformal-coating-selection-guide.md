## Why Conformal Coatings Matter

Printed circuit board assemblies (PCBAs) deployed outside the controlled environment of a sealed enclosure are exposed to a range of environmental threats that can degrade performance and ultimately cause field failures. Moisture and humidity are the most pervasive hazards, promoting electrochemical migration between closely spaced conductors, accelerating corrosion of exposed metal surfaces, and reducing surface insulation resistance (SIR) to levels that can cause parasitic leakage currents or outright short circuits. Chemical contaminants such as salt spray in marine and coastal environments, sulfur compounds in industrial settings, and agricultural chemicals in outdoor equipment further accelerate these degradation mechanisms. Conformal coatings are thin polymeric films, typically 25 to 75 micrometers thick, applied directly over the populated PCB surface to provide a protective barrier against these environmental stressors. By conforming to the complex three-dimensional topography of the assembled board, including component leads, solder joints, and traces, these coatings deliver protection without significantly increasing the package volume or weight, making them a cost-effective alternative to hermetic sealing for a wide range of commercial, industrial, and automotive applications.

## Coating Chemistries Compared

The five principal conformal coating chemistries, each designated by a letter code in IPC-CC-830 and MIL-I-46058C, offer distinct performance profiles suited to different operating environments and process constraints. **Acrylic (AR) coatings** are among the most widely used due to their ease of application, rapid drying, and excellent reworkability since they dissolve readily in common solvents. They provide good moisture resistance and acceptable dielectric properties but offer limited chemical and solvent resistance, making them less suitable for harsh chemical environments. **Silicone (SR) coatings** excel in applications requiring a wide operating temperature range, from below -65 to above 200 degrees Celsius, and offer outstanding flexibility, which is advantageous for assemblies subjected to mechanical vibration or thermal cycling. Their soft, rubber-like film provides excellent moisture protection but is mechanically fragile and easily abraded. **Polyurethane (UR) coatings** deliver superior chemical and solvent resistance combined with good humidity protection and a hard, abrasion-resistant finish. However, they are more difficult to rework and typically require longer cure times or elevated-temperature curing. **Epoxy (ER) coatings** form the hardest and most chemically resistant films but are essentially non-reworkable and can crack under thermal stress due to their rigid nature. **Parylene (XY) coatings**, deposited by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) rather than liquid application, produce an exceptionally uniform and pinhole-free film with outstanding barrier properties and biocompatibility, making them the gold standard for medical implantable devices and aerospace applications, albeit at significantly higher cost and with limited reworkability.

## Application Methods and Process Considerations

The choice of application method has a direct impact on coating uniformity, throughput, and total process cost, and it must be matched to both the coating chemistry and the production volume. **Spray coating**, either manual with a handheld gun or automated using selective conformal coating machines, is the most versatile and widely adopted method. Automated selective spray systems use programmable nozzle paths to coat only the designated areas of the board, eliminating the need for masking in many cases and achieving cycle times compatible with high-volume production. **Dip coating** immerses the entire assembly in a bath of coating material and is well suited to high-throughput applications where complete board coverage is acceptable. Withdrawal speed and material viscosity control the resulting film thickness, and the process is particularly efficient for double-sided assemblies. **Brush coating** is a low-cost manual method typically reserved for prototyping, rework, or small-lot production where the investment in automated equipment is not justified. It provides adequate coverage for simple board layouts but is operator-dependent and difficult to reproduce consistently. For all liquid-applied coatings, surface cleanliness is paramount. Flux residues, fingerprints, and other contaminants beneath the coating film can cause adhesion failures and trap corrosive species against the board surface, negating the protection the coating is intended to provide. A thorough cleaning step, validated by ionic contamination testing per IPC-TM-650 Method 2.3.25, should precede coating application.

## Standards Compliance and Qualification Testing

Conformal coatings for electronic assemblies are governed by two principal specifications: IPC-CC-830B, the industry standard maintained by IPC (Association Connecting Electronics Industries), and MIL-I-46058C, the legacy military specification that, while formally cancelled, continues to be referenced in many defense and aerospace procurement documents. IPC-CC-830B defines a comprehensive suite of qualification tests including insulation resistance after humidity exposure, dielectric withstand voltage, flexibility, thermal shock resistance, fungus resistance, and flammability. Materials are classified by chemistry type and qualified to specific test group requirements. For automotive applications, additional requirements from standards such as ISO 16750 (environmental conditions and testing for electrical and electronic equipment) and manufacturer-specific specifications may apply, often imposing extended temperature ranges, salt spray endurance (per ISO 9227), and resistance to automotive fluids including brake fluid, transmission fluid, and fuel. When selecting a conformal coating for a new design, engineers should establish the applicable specification requirements early in the design phase, as retroactive changes to coating chemistry can necessitate costly re-qualification of the entire assembly.

## Making the Right Choice for Your Application

Selecting the optimal conformal coating requires a systematic evaluation of the operating environment, reliability requirements, production constraints, and total cost of ownership. For general-purpose indoor electronics with moderate humidity exposure and the need for field reworkability, acrylic coatings offer the best combination of performance and ease of use. Applications in extreme temperature environments, such as under-hood automotive or industrial motor control systems, benefit from the thermal stability and flexibility of silicone coatings. Where chemical resistance is the primary driver, as in agricultural equipment, chemical processing plants, or marine electronics, polyurethane or epoxy coatings provide the necessary barrier properties. For the highest levels of protection with minimal film thickness, parylene coatings are unmatched, though the CVD process requires specialized equipment and higher per-unit costs. CAPLINQ's LinqCoat product line offers formulations across multiple chemistry types, engineered to meet IPC-CC-830B qualification requirements and backed by comprehensive technical datasheets with tested performance data. Our applications engineering team can assist with coating selection, compatibility assessments, and process optimization to help ensure that your PCB assemblies achieve the target reliability profile in their intended operating environment.
